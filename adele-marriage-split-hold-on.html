And that’s a real wound for me that I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to heal.”</p><p>When asked about the effect their split had on her, Adele added: “My entire life fell apart and I had no warning of it.”</p><p>Putting her grief down on paper wasn’t easy and Adele said 30, her fourth studio album, was difficult to make.</p><p>She said: “It was bloody hard work. I was singing things I didn’t even realise I was feeling or thinking.</p><p>“But I’m really, really proud of it and I feel like I can’t unlock a door for my own mental health and take the key with me.</p><p>“I’ve got to leave it in the door for everyone else — and I’m in a strong place now where I feel like I can put that vulnerability out.”</p><p>Adele has also filmed a one-off ITV special which will air two days after the release of 30.</p><p>The hour-long show, called An Audience With Adele, sees the superstar perform a number of her new songs and some of her biggest classics, including Make You Feel My Love and Chasing ­Pavements.</p><p>It is not to be missed.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>RED HOT RIRI IS A ROCKY CHICK</h2><p>RIHANNA looked like she really did have Love On The Brain when she watched boyfriend ASAP Rocky perform in concert.</p><p>The Bajan singerhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/who/rihanna/ made sure her lover could see her in the crowd – and wore various shades of red for the gig at the Long Beach Convention Center in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000692258989.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000692195784.jpg><p>Along with a scarlet leather mini-skirt and checked handkerchief top, Ri-Ri wore a maroon coat and matching stiletto heels.</p><p>Rihanna and ASAP started dating last year and have been almost inseparable since.</p><p>Given how loved up these two are, I wouldn’t be surprised if we heard the sound of wedding bells soon.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>GHOSTED OLLY HITS BACK AT SWEET TALKING GUYS</h2><p>OLLY ALEXANDER bare his soul on Years & Years next album.</p><p>The singer releases Night Call in 2022 and has revealed the record’s next single is inspired by men who have strung him along in texts before ghosting him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6dc72fec-3a7d-438c-a41e-b5be584f05d5.jpg><p>Olly said: “It is called Sweet Talker and it is about someone who talks really nice to you and tells you a lot of sweet nothings, then a couple of days later they stop replying to you.</p><p>“I have experienced some of these guys myself. The album is about a few guys and relationships that have done me wrong and I am reclaiming my power.</p><p>"I made all this music during the pandemic. I did not do any ballads, I wanted it upbeat.”</p><p>During an appearance on Swedish chat show Skavlan, which will air later this month, Olly also admitted he is refusing to delete a voicemail from Elton John following their jaw-dropping Brits performance.</p><p>He said: “He watched It’s A Sin and called up everybody in the cast and he asked if we could sing at The Brits.</p><p>“I still have his voicemail on my phone. To have Elton John’s voice on my phone..."</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ELUSIVE HARRY</h2><p>BRIDESMAIDS director Paul Feig has revealed Harry Styles left him gutted after he spurned the chance to play the lead in 2019 flick Last Christmas.</p><p>Paul said: “I love Harry.

It is very dark and I think a lot of people are going to relate.</p><p>“I’ve done about nine songs so far but I am still writing it as I am a big perfectionist and I literally don’t want any of the songs on the album to sound like skipper.</p><p>“I want every song to sound like a single.
