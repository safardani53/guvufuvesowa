High humidity levels also impact breathing, so people with asthma may want to keep the humidity levels lower,” says Lane Dixon, Vice President of Operations at Aire Serv, a Neighborly company.

One thing that really made it stand out was that it’s made to connect with the Honeywell Air Comfort App, which allows you to control the machine from your phone — or even using your Alexa. The app lets you switch between the high and low fan settings (which is not a feature every dehumidifier has) and tells you when the tank is full or when the air filter needs cleaning. (Both of the latter are indicated on the machine itself, too.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also found that the fan noise it made was not a bother at all, and we loved how easy it was to set up. The price is great too — especially given all of the included features. Throughout testing, we did notice that the built-in hygrometer wasn’t the most accurate, so perhaps consider investing in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a standalone one</a> for your space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capacity</strong>: 30 pints per day | <strong>Tank</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 20 pints | <strong>Coverage</strong>: 1000 sq ft | <strong>Features</strong>: Built-in hygrometer, humidistat, auto-off, auto-restart, auto-defrost, sleep mode, timer, drain tube included, controllable remotely via Honeywell Air Comfort App, compatible with Alexa</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mini-eva-dry-edv-1100-electric-petite-dehumidifier></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Mini</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eva-Dry Electric Petite Dehumidifier</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Eva-dry Edv-1100 Electric Petite Dehumidifier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kmZv0nrtEDxJ6SdIYF_x2ahS9b4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eva-dry-edv-1100-electric-petite-dehumidifier-52c9004548324cce831c5f66f41d37d4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>This model is extremely quiet, we couldn’t even hear it over regular noises like ceiling fans and conversations.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The translucent tank makes it really easy to see when it’s full.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s at an affordable price point.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mini dehumidifier earned perfect scores across the board in our lab (and was the only one to do so aside from our <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Best Overall pick</a>). If you’re looking for a small machine that’ll keep some humidity at bay and won’t be a disturbance in any way, this is the ideal unit for you.

And we were stoked by how quiet it is: We couldn’t even hear it over a fan!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, that small size means that it doesn’t come with as many bells and whistles as some of the bigger units we tested, like a built-in hygrometer, for example, but its functionality and low volume — especially coupled with its low price — make it a fantastic buy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capacity</strong>: 0.5 pints per day | <strong>Tank</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 1 pint | <strong>Coverage</strong>: 138 sq ft | <strong>Features</strong>: Auto-off</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-pump-ge-apel50lz-dehumidifier-with-built-in-pump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Pump</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>GE Dehumidifier with Built-in Pump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Walmart GE 50 Pt E-STARPortable Dehumidifier w/ Pump for Wet Space, Grey, APEW50LZ" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ZaP2Rln-i9ISJG5cC9c9oTVDokY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ge-50-pt-e-starportable-dehumidifier-w-pump-for-wet-space-grey-apew50lz-25be6b5751874c3cb2a3b71664b1cd5a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The pump allows you to empty the tank with ease from up to 16 feet away.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The tank shuts off and makes a beeping noise when full.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a three-speed fan.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve been looking for a way to empty your dehumidifier into a drain that’s high up — like down a sink or out a window — we have the solution for you. This great dehumidifier from GE has a built-in pump (with an included tube) that will let you do just that. The tank has an automatic shut-off and also makes a loud beeping noise when full. The pump allows you to empty the tank without taking out, carrying, and dumping the tank — or without using the continuous drain hose. Rather, the pump pushes the water out a thin tube, which allows you to drain anywhere up to 16 feet away. To use, just attach the tube, place the other end in your desired draining location, and turn on the pump feature, and once the bucket fills all the way the unit will drain itself (and will do so every time the bucket fills until the pump feature is turned off).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the pump feature, we loved how effective this dehumidifier was, taking our testing room from soggy to fresh in just a couple of hours. We did find that it was a bit loud when it was on high, but were pleased that it had both medium and low fan speeds as well, so we were able to control the noise a bit. Overall, we think this is a great buy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capacity</strong>: 50 pints per day | <strong>Tank</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 15 pints | <strong>Coverage</strong>: 4500 sq ft | <strong>Features</strong>: Built-in hygrometer, humidistat, auto-off, auto-restart, auto-defrost, timer, pump with included tube, multi-speed fan</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-basements-frigidaire-ffad3533w1-moderate-humidity-35-pint-dehumidifier></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Basements</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frigidaire 35-Pint Dehumidifier</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frigidaire 35 Pint High Efficiency Dehumidifier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dd2fOytZa0a_TCF7KwVaVRl620k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frigidaire-ffad3533w1-dehumidifier-moderate-humidity-35-pint-capacity-with-a-easy-to-clean-washable-filter-and-custom-humidity-control-906a187acdab4b499ef58962fafd0712.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>It quickly cleared out the humidity and must of a damp basement.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The tank has a cover so water doesn’t slosh around when carrying it to the sink.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The machine is quiet, so you can listen to music or watch television in the same room.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We absolutely loved how well this dehumidifier cleared out both humidity and that icky musty basement smell. After just a few hours in a fairly damp basement (condensation on pipes, puddles under washing machines) everything was visibly dry, and the air was much less heavy. Plus, this dehumidifier totally cleared out the musty odor. Even running a test entirely at a low speed, we noticed a palpable difference in humidity in the space. One of our favorite features is the tank cover. This makes it easy to transport the full tank to a sink to dispose of it without water spilling out of the tank. It’s also quiet — you can listen to music or watch a show in the same room without cranking up the volume. If we have one critique, it’s that the power cord is a bit short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also really liked that the filter on this unit is super easy to snap out, wipe clean, and snap back in, making this unit a great option for spaces where you want to clear through allergens like mold, mildew, and dust mites — especially basements. It wasn’t super noisy, was easy to set up, and was reasonably priced, making this unit a great purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capacity</strong>: 35 pints per day | <strong>Tank</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 17 pints | <strong>Coverage</strong>: 4500 sq ft | <strong>Features</strong>: Built-in hygrometer, humidistat, auto-off, timer, multi-speed fan</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smart-midea-mad50s1qwt-50-pint-cube-dehumidifier></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Smart</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Midea 50-Pint Cube Dehumidifier</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Midea MAD50S1QWT 50-Pint Cube Dehumidifier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ec0z9_xT4KAyMXJxML7oG0d6Rds=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/midea-mad50s1qwt-50-pint-cube-dehumidifier-272fa5fafe93460a8a25966965883c83.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>This model has a unique and efficient design — the motor fits inside the bucket — so it takes up less storage space.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It has a huge bucket that has a capacity of over 33 pints — most of the others on our list are in the 15 to 20-pint range.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The bucket has wheels and is easy to empty.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>When using a continuous drain hose, the bucket must be stored elsewhere.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The built-in hygrometer reads a little bit high.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This smart Midea dehumidifier had some really unique features that absolutely blew us away. Firstly, it connects to the Midea Cube Air App via Wi-Fi, which allows you to control it remotely and receive important notifications (like the bucket is full). The app is also compatible with Alexa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also loved its unique design, wherein the machine portion stores inside the bucket when not in use. This allows for small cube-shaped storage, and, when you are using it, a ton of tank capacity. The machine portion sits atop the bucket when in use, which also means that it’s extremely easy to empty: Just lift the machine off the bucket, and wheel the bucket where you want to dump it. No awkwardly pulling out heavy tanks here! You can also use it with a drain hose (which is included) and skip the bucket altogether for an even smaller usage of space. This does mean, though, that the bucket has to be stored elsewhere, as the machine portion does not fit on top of the bucket when the drain hose is attached.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And when in use, we found that it cleared out humidity quickly and effectively, and was a lot quieter than many other models.

It has a great feature called SmartDry, which allows you to select a goal humidity, and the unit will adjust its fan levels accordingly: This is different from humidistat functions because those shut off when they reach the desired humidity and turn back on when it changes enough for the machine to read a difference. This stays on at varying fan levels, keeping the humidity in the space at the same level, even if ambient factors impact it. We found that this function kept our testing space at a comfortable humidity level without any attention, even with intense humidity changes from tons of rain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also loved how easy it was to set up (just take the tape off), and how accurate the built-in hygrometer read. It did only read on percentages of 5, so we couldn’t get precise readings but were pleased to see that within that range it was always exactly accurate. We did have some trouble getting the unit to connect to the app, so you could consider the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">version without the app connectivity</a>, which works the same in every other way, and is a little bit cheaper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capacity</strong>: 50 pints per day | <strong>Tank</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 15 pints | <strong>Coverage</strong>: 4000 sq ft | <strong>Features</strong>: Built-in hygrometer, humidistat, auto-off, auto-defrost, timer, pump, multi-speed fan, SmartDry function, controllable remotely with SmartHQ App</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-garages-amazon-basics-35-pint-dehumidifier></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Garages</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Basics Dehumidifier</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Basics Dehumidifier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/aK34OHR85XXkLlVM89DFRs5g7eA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dehumidifier-de8acb437e094230a65d48b8703fe22f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Amazon Basics dehumidifier was by far one of the most impressive throughout our tests — we saw a noticeable change in humidity in just the first 10 minutes of use. And the space we were testing in was worlds different after an overnight of use: usually, we’d have to wipe down the windows from overnight condensation, but not with this puppy running. It cleared out an average of 44 percent of the original humidity in the testing room throughout our tests (in one round, clearing out as much as 52 percent), which we found pretty impressive. And we loved that the built-in hygrometer read almost perfectly, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved that it was extremely easy to set up: Just peel some tape and attach a handle and you’re good to go.

If you’re looking for an easy way to clear out that humidity without breaking the bank, this is a great solution. This light, portable, and quiet dehumidifier by Pro Breeze works like a charm. When we first turned it on, it started dripping inside the tank with collected humidity within just a couple of moments and helped turn the air in our testing space from humid and stuffy to clear and breathable. The tank is clear so you can easily see when it’s time to empty it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We especially loved its small size — it’s under 3 pounds — making it easy to move in and out of the car. We also appreciated how quiet it was, as a few minutes waiting for it to clear out the car air before hitting the road can be spent listening to the radio without a loud fan obstructing your fun. It required no setup aside from plugging it into an electrical outlet, is super easy to empty, and comes at a great price. Overall, a great option for small spaces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capacity</strong>: .5 pints per day | <strong>Tank</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: .8 pints | <strong>Coverage</strong>: 150 sq ft | <strong>Features</strong>: Auto-off</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-bedrooms-whirlpool-whad40pcw-40-pint-dehumidifier-with-built-in-pump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Bedrooms</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Whirlpool 40-Pint Dehumidifier with Built-In Pump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Whirlpool WHAD40PCW 40-Pint Dehumidifier with Built-In Pump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dEps-oWGLvZCJGnbBT3Uen6KcjI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/whirlpool-whad40pcw-40-pint-dehumidifier-with-built-in-pump-f1fb07efcb324d6098fe686a80b9eec8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Features</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This was the quietest model we tested.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You can easily tell when the tank is full via the tank window and indicator light.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It has strong built-in handles for easy removal, a feature not many models have.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Folks who are looking for a dehumidifier for living spaces, this is the one for you. This dehumidifier from Whirlpool was exceptionally quiet, which we really appreciated when trying to find one that would be suitable for a space like a bedroom. Plus, the fan has three speeds, which is great if you want it to run a little more quietly at times. We also found that it cleared out the humidity in smaller, sometimes very wet, spaces (like bathrooms and laundry rooms) really fast, which is a great feature if you’re hoping to freshen up the air in a space without a big to-do.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also loved the easy setup (just pop the wheels in the bottom and you’re good to go), the tank window, and the indicator light that allows you to see how full it is. Plus, it was extremely portable, as the body of the dehumidifier has a built-in handle on each side, allowing confident lifting, even when it’s heavier from being full.

It includes a turbo fan function that works extremely fast and efficiently, which is ideal for big or really wet spaces. With the turbo function on we felt the difference in the space in just a half hour. Since the tank is not very large, you’ll need to empty it frequently if you’re dehumidifying a large humid space. Fortunately, the built-in handles make easy work of emptying the tank.

We found that it pulled a ton of humidity from the air throughout our testing periods — so much so that we could feel the difference from a room away! Each time we went to check the (fairly large) tank, it was full — meaning it was utterly draining the air of humidity. The unit is heavy, but it includes wheels to make it easier to transport it to a sink or drain for emptying.

It also comes with a drain hose to connect to the pump on the back, which allows you to empty the tank without taking it out, sloshing on the way to the sink or tub, and dumping it. The pump pushes the water out of the tank (rather than just relying on pressure and gravity), so you can drain it quickly in any direction (like upwards out a window).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Capacity</strong>: 50 pints per day | <strong>Tank</strong> <strong>Size</strong>: 16.9 pints | <strong>Coverage</strong>: Not listed | <strong>Features</strong>: Built-in hygrometer, humidistat, auto-off, auto-restart, timer, pump with included tube, multi-speed fan</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-dehumidifier></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Dehumidifier</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Capacity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The capacity is the amount of water a dehumidifier can remove from the air over a 24-hour period, measured in pints per day.
