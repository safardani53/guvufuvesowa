Young Ryan started playing basketball under his Father’s influence from a very young age. His Father, Joe, was a sport-loving person as he too was a soccer player in his college days.</p><p>Moreover, his parents set up a well-equipped basketball training ground to further encourage their child.</p><p>As a result, Ryan dedicated most of his time to practicing various shots and learning techniques before stepping onto the court.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ryan-Arcidiacono-with-His-Parents-during-his-High-School-Days.jpg><p>He later joined a basketball camp while still a kid and performed well for his high school team.</p><p>Impressed by his mastery at such a young age, Jay Wright, the then head coach of Villanova, remarked that he would play for Villanova one day.</p><p>After graduating high school, Arcidiacono joined Villanova University and played for the Wildcats, eventually proving the coach right.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from himself and his parents, Ryan has three older siblings and younger twin siblings in his family.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; C.J. Miles Bio: Early Life, Family, Education & Basketball >>></strong></a></p><h2>Ryan Arcidiacono | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Ryan played for Neshaminy High School until 2012. Jerry Devine, the then-high school coach, immediately recognized his talent and helped him further sharpen his gameplay.</p><p>As a sophomore, the young player led the team to the PIAA Class AAAA tournament. He averaged 18 points per game and attained an important place in the Class AAAA second team in that tournament.</p><p>Likewise, he traveled to North Carolina to participate in the Bob Gibbons Tournament of Champions. Unfortunately, he severely injured his face in the tournament’s first game, requiring stitches.</p><p>However, he decided to return to the court against the doctor’s advice. As a result, he played many other games in the tournament. Quite surprisingly, his stats were terrific despite the injury.</p><p>He continued his top-class performance throughout the season in his junior year. However, he could not avoid injuries, which constantly slowed him down.</p><p>His senior year at the high school was the most unforgettable one. Shortly after his junior season, he had a back injury and barely recovered.</p><p>Furthermore, he was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back and missed his entire senior season.</p><p>However, he completed his high school career as the all-time leading scorer. Moreover, ESPN named him one of the top 50 seniors in the country.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Soon after high school, Ryan Arcidiacono joined the&nbsp;Villanova Wildcats. He had not fully recovered but made a debut against the University of the District of Columbia, where he scored 11 points.</p><p>Moving on, he posted 25 points against Marshall in the next game. He became the second player to score these many points after Scottie Reynolds in his first year.</p><p>Later that same year, Ryan led his team to the NCAA tournament the same season, and even though he gave an amazing performance, the Wildcats remained trophyless.</p><p>In the same season, he averaged 11.9 points, 3.5 assists, and 2.1 rebounds per game in this tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>He regained his health and performed very well in the second season. As a sophomore, he recorded 9.9 points, 3.5 assists, and 2.4 rebounds per contest.</p><p>Arcidiacono had a good year as a junior, except that he suffered some injuries, including getting hit on his nose by a Seton Hall player. However, he recovered soon and played for his team for the rest of the season.</p><p>In his final year at college, Ryan got shortlisted on Oscar Robertson Award preseason watchlist. Similarly, he was also named among the ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award.</p><p>In his last season, he finished his college career averaging 12.5 points and 4.2 rebounds per game.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Sadly, Ryan went undrafted in the 2016 NFL draft even though his performance throughout college football was remarkable. However, San Antonio Spurs picked him for the NBA Summer League and relieved him.</p><p>However, the club released him just after three preseason games. Sometimes later, he intended to join the Italian team Juvecaserta Basket. However, he withdrew after the club could not make it to Serie A.</p><p>On July 25, 2017, he signed a two-way contract with the Chicago Bulls.</p><p>As a result, Ryan became the first person in NBA history to sign a two-way contract. In his first NBA debut, the athlete posted 8 points, 4 rebounds, and 8 assists against the Philadelphia 76ers.</p><p>Moreover, he played for most of his time in the NBA G League for the Windy City Bulls and played very well. He averaged 13.8 points, 5 rebounds, and 8.6 assists per game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ryan-in-the-Chicago-Bulls-Jersey-1024x1024.jpg><p>Likewise, he had 7.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, and four assists per game in the 2018 NBA Summer League.</p><p>Ryan remained for two more seasons with the Bulls before eventually transferring to the Boston Celtics. Unfortunately, the club released him ten days later, and he joined Maine Celtics as an affiliate player.</p><p>He remained in the Celtics for some months getting very little playtime. Then, he joined the New York Knicks in 2022, but he did not appear in any games before being freed at the end of January 2022.</p><p>On January 31, 2022, the Celtics signed a contract with Arcidiacono again.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Ryan Arcidiano has won numerous individual awards and honors. Moreover, he has won a couple of championships playing for different teams.</p><p>Some of his achievements include:</p><ul><li>NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player (2016)</li><li>Big East Co-player of The Year (2015)</li><li>NCAA Champion (2016)</li><li>First Team All-Big East (2015)</li><li>Second Team All-Big East (2014, 2016)</li></ul><h2>Age, Weight & Height</h2><p>As of 2022, Ryan Arcidiacono is <span>29</span> years of age.

The two began dating in 2021 and have lived together since the same year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ryan-with-his-girlfriend-Clare-Bear-1024x1024.jpg><p>However, he was once in a relationship with Kristin McGrath for quite a long time.

His main source of earnings is the league games. However, his professional life has not been as he had previously expected.</p><p>He has earned about $7.5 million in his entire professional career. In his first year for the Bulls, he received around $3 million.</p><p>The club then paid him another $4 million playing the next three years.</p><p>He earned comparatively much lower while in the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs, as he did not get much time to play there.</p><p>So, he made significantly less than he had desired playing professional basketball.
