She was hit by a car while crossing the street, leaving John traumatized and inspiring him to dedicate the songs “Julia” and “Mother” to her memory.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John lost contact with his father for some time before the two reunited at the height of the Beatles' fame in the 1960s. In 1968, John told a journalist that he had practically forgotten his father, saying, “It was like he was dead,” per Bob Spitz’s biography The Beatles – The Biography.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From their love story meeting as teenagers to their turbulent relationships with John, here’s everything to know about John Lennon’s parents.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-julia-and-alfred-met-when-they-were-teenagers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Julia and Alfred met when they were teenagers</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>John Lennon in 1977 in New York City, New York.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vinnie Zuffante/Getty&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first time Alfred saw Julia was at a club in Liverpool, England, when she was 14 years old and he was 15. They later met again in a park where he had gone with a friend to meet girls, Spitz wrote in his biography on the Beatles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eleven years after they first met, on Dec. 3, 1938, Julia and Alfred married in secret after she proposed to him. Her family did not approve of the marriage, according to Spitz, with her father even threatening to disown her if she ever lived with a “lover.” He asked Alfred to show proof that he could financially support his daughter, but Alfred signed up to be a Merchant Navy steward on a ship that would go to the Mediterranean Sea and came up short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After returning from his position three months later, Alfred attempted to find a job as an entertainer, but to no avail.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alfred-was-serving-as-a-merchant-seaman-when-john-was-born></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Alfred was serving as a merchant seaman when John was born</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 1940, Julia found out she was pregnant. However, World War II had started by then and Alfred was called back to sea, though he sent money home regularly, per Spitz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John was born on Oct. 9, 1940, while Alfred was still abroad. Around the time of his birth, Julia began dating John Dykins and soon the two moved in together, even though she was still legally married to Alfred.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-julias-sister-raised-john></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Julia’s sister raised John</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>John Lennon circa 1973 in New York City, New York.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vinnie Zuffante/Getty&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Julia’s older sister, Mary “Mimi” Smith, was there for Julia since John’s birth but didn’t always approve of her parenting choices. Ultimately, John came to live with Mimi and was raised in her home, though he frequently visited Julia and Dykins’ house nearby, John’s first wife, Cynthia Lennon, wrote in her biography of the Beatles star, John.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 1946, Alfred came back to visit John and took him to Blackpool, England, on vacation. However, he secretly planned to emigrate with him to New Zealand. When Julia found out, she followed them to Blackpool with Dykins by her side, and, in the end, John went back to live with his mother, Cynthia wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, after a few weeks, Julia handed John back to Mimi and he continued to live there through his childhood and adolescence. John later blamed himself for his mom giving him back to his aunt, saying, “My mother ... couldn’t cope with me," per Spitz's biography.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite his living with Mimi, John remained close to Julia. She bought him his first guitar and taught him how to play banjo and ukelele chords. In John, Cynthia said that John and Julia shared a love for music and the two would enjoy listening to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Elvis Presley</a> together while dancing around the kitchen.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-julia-had-other-children-despite-still-being-married-to-alfred></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Julia had other children despite still being married to Alfred</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Julia never officially divorced Alfred, she had moved on in the few years after John’s birth and welcomed three more children. She first gave birth to daughter Victoria in 1945 with a soldier, “Taffy” Williams, whom she met on an evening out and placed her for adoption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Julia also welcomed two more daughters during her relationship with Dykins — Julia Baird was born on March 5, 1947, and Jackie was born on Oct. 26, 1949. During a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2019 interview</a>, Baird reminisced on growing up with her mother and watching John and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Paul McCartney</a>, whom she called the "dream team" play the banjo and guitar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She was very funny, very very witty. She was a happy mother and an active mother doing things with us," said Baird. "My mother was very musical. We had a piano that she played, we had the banjo."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alfred-and-john-had-a-turbulent-relationship></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Alfred and John had a turbulent relationship</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Alfred Lennon and Pauline Cole in 1968.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Trinity Mirror / Mirrorpix / Alamy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Alfred's plans to leave for New Zealand with his son fell through, Spitz wrote that he and John did not reconnect again until John was at the height of his fame with the Beatles in the 1960s. Alfred was working as a kitchen porter at a hotel in England when someone showed him a newspaper clipping of John and asked if the two were related, Cynthia wrote in John.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The estranged father then decided to visit John, showing up with a journalist at the famous North End Music Store office where the Beatles’ manager, Brian Epstein, was stunned when Alfred announced himself as John’s dad. Epstein phoned John, who quickly arrived but refused to shake his father’s hand, merely asking what he wanted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You can't turn your back on your family, no matter what they've done,” Alfred reportedly told John, per Spitz’s biography.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite Alfred’s desire for reconciliation, John turned him and the journalist away, according to Spitz. A few weeks later, Alfred showed up at John’s home where the singer’s wife, Cynthia, let him in. However, Alfred left after waiting a few hours for John, who never arrived.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cynthia encouraged John to reach out to his father and a few months later, John relented, admitting to Cynthia, “He's a bit 'wacky,' like me,” per Cynthia’s biography John.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before he died on April 1, 1976, Alfred wrote a manuscript detailing his life story that he left for John. In it, he told his side of the story with Julia which allowed John to have some understanding of him. When he died, Alfred’s then-wife Pauline called John, and the two reconciled while Alfred was on his deathbed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-julia-died-in-1958></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Julia died in 1958</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Julia was visiting Mimi on July 15, 1958, when she was crossing the street and was hit by a car.
