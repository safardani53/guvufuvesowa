Very recently, she also made her silver screen debut with&nbsp;Birds Of A Feather 2. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Birds of Feather 2</strong>: Watch Kash Doll in her acting debut in the 2018 American drama Birds of Feather 2 (Published: 22 April 2018) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here are some relatively less known wikis about Kash Doll, including her real name, net worth, height, songs, parents, boyfriend and her real hair.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Alexis Dziena Age 34 Wiki: Relationship Status To Family Conflict On Money" rel=follow>Alexis Dziena Age 34 Wiki: Relationship Status To Family Conflict On Money</a></p><h3><strong>1. Kash Doll Wiki-like Bio: Real Name, Parents, Height</strong></h3><p>On 14 March 1992, Kash Doll was born as in the motor city, Detroit, Michigan, with the real name Arkeisha Knight. After her father passed away during her early age, she was raised by her mother and her stepfather, along with her six siblings.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Interested in poetry and words from an early age, Kash graduated from Detroit City High School. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Wikis say, Kash stands at an average height of 5 ft. and 5 inches and has a dark black real hair, which she changes a lot.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3><strong>2. Kash Worked As Stripper During Her Struggling Days</strong></h3><p>While she always wanted to be a rapper, during her early years she had to work as a stripper to make her ends meet. Kash, however, was not new to working and earning for her own, having already worked as a&nbsp;babysitter, janitor, and worker in Better Made Chip factory.</p><p>Although the stripper job proved to be very profitable, she didn’t hold on to it for long and eventually started working towards her dream of becoming a rapper. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3><strong>3. Kash Doll Achieved Critical Praise & Mouth Watering Net Worth</strong></h3><p>In 2014, after releasing a remix version of Tinashe’s 2 On, Kash started to be recognized around the Detroit R&B scene and was able to land&nbsp;several show bookings. She independently released her first single, which got her not only positive reviews but also landed her record deal with BMB.</p><p>Since then she has released numerous mix-tapes and an EP, Kashing Out, with RMMR record label.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Peter Gunz Wiki: Engaged To Girlfriend Of Age 18, Wife Breathing Fire" rel=follow>Peter Gunz Wiki: Engaged To Girlfriend Of Age 18, Wife Breathing Fire</a></p><p>Like her name, her social media, and songs' lyrics suggest, Kash loves the cash and the extravagant lifestyle it buys for her. Not that she cannot afford as she has earned herself a fortune through her career in rap. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kash has come a long way from her early struggling days and has earned a net worth that can quench anyone's thirst, the sum reaching up to more than $ 600 thousand, according to the wikis.</p><h3><strong>4. Rumor Mill Confuses Kash's Boyfriend, Big Shawn, With Big Sean</strong></h3><p>As is the case with most of the celebrities, Kash doll was rumored to be with someone only because she was linked with the man for a record deal. The man, in this case, was Big Sean.</p><p>The rumors were fuelled by an Instagram photo of Kash wishing Big Shawn&nbsp;happy birthday and calling him her baby. As it turned out, Big Shawn was not misspelled Big Sean, but a very different person and Kash’s boyfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><p><strong>Boyfriend Big Shawn</strong>: Kash Doll with her boyfriend Big Shawn during the time of his birthday (photo: hip-hopvibe.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Unrelated to her actual relationship status, Kash seems to joke about already being someone's wife in Twitter, probably to ward off the fans.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><strong>5. Snap With Drake Breaks Kash's Relationship With Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>The rumor mill had another more devastating effect for Kash. When she uploaded a rather cozy photo of herself with beloved rapper Drake, the rumor erupted saying that Drake and Kash were now new dream hip-hop couple. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Keep Reading:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Lamorne Morris Dating!

Kash seemed pretty angry about the prospect,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Why is it that as soon as you post a picture or you around somebody or something you dating them?</p><p>While her personal front might not be awesome, her professional life sure is. With all the hard work she did during her ascend to the top, she deserves the fame--and the luxury that she has come to earn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmLaiuo6kmKygXZm8rbiMsKCkoV2XvLqy0aKcp5xdp7KiuIynmKadXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkash-doll-wiki-boyfriend-real-name-html.html&text=Kash%20Doll%20Wiki%3a%20Drake%20Hugs%2c%20Boyfriend%20Leaves%3b%20Real%20Name%2c%20Height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkash-doll-wiki-boyfriend-real-name-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkash-doll-wiki-boyfriend-real-name-html.html&title=Kash%20Doll%20Wiki%3a%20Drake%20Hugs%2c%20Boyfriend%20Leaves%3b%20Real%20Name%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkash-doll-wiki-boyfriend-real-name-html.html&title=Kash%20Doll%20Wiki%3a%20Drake%20Hugs%2c%20Boyfriend%20Leaves%3b%20Real%20Name%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkash-doll-wiki-boyfriend-real-name-html.html&title=Kash%20Doll%20Wiki%3a%20Drake%20Hugs%2c%20Boyfriend%20Leaves%3b%20Real%20Name%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkash-doll-wiki-boyfriend-real-name-html.html&description=Kash%20Doll%20Wiki%3a%20Drake%20Hugs%2c%20Boyfriend%20Leaves%3b%20Real%20Name%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lori-wickelhaus-16-and-pregnant-star-sentenced-to-jail-for-child.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lori Wickelhaus, 16 and Pregnant Star, Sentenced to Jail for Child Pornography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gallery-sitemap.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="June Whitfield">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
