According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, his former female assistant offered him a body massage via text –– and to some capacity, he was entertaining the idea.</p><p>Drew discussed the traumatic situation, saying, “I thought we were in a better place. Then, last summer, there were some things that happened."</p><p>By “things," it’s speculated that she is referring to the inappropriate text conversation. As of now, the name and age of Ralph's former female assistant haven’t been publicized. What we do know now is that she no longer works for him. It’s unclear whether she was fired or chose to resign on her own.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How have other cast members from 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta' responded?</h2><p>Drew isn’t the only one who is bothered by Ralph's actions at the moment.

I have seen the way he speaks to her.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“If my husband said that to me, I would flip this table over, because that is so disrespectful.

During their group discussion, Drew made it known that Ralph was no longer sleeping in the same bed with her. Instead, he’d been sleeping in their son’s room.</p><p>Dr. Ken ask them to come to an agreement in therapy not to have any combative or argumentative conversations for 30 consecutive days. He specifically said, “No yelling. No attacking."</p><p>To up the ante on the agreement, he added that if anyone loses their cool and blows up within the next 30 days, the other person gets to ask for whatever they want over the span of 24 hours. Drew and Ralph's therapist is obviously doing his best to help the couple as much as he possibly can.</p><p>New episodes of The Real Housewives of Atlanta air Sundays on Bravo at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66tvMdmp6KspKKur3nArKqiq6SWu7U%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fralph-pittman-assistant.html&text=Ralph%20Pittman%20From%20%27Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%27%20Was%20Caught%20Texting%20His%20Assistant%20Inappropriately%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fralph-pittman-assistant.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fralph-pittman-assistant.html&title=Ralph%20Pittman%20From%20%27Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%27%20Was%20Caught%20Texting%20His%20Assistant%20Inappropriately%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fralph-pittman-assistant.html&title=Ralph%20Pittman%20From%20%27Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%27%20Was%20Caught%20Texting%20His%20Assistant%20Inappropriately%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fralph-pittman-assistant.html&title=Ralph%20Pittman%20From%20%27Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%27%20Was%20Caught%20Texting%20His%20Assistant%20Inappropriately%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fralph-pittman-assistant.html&description=Ralph%20Pittman%20From%20%27Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%27%20Was%20Caught%20Texting%20His%20Assistant%20Inappropriately%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./uni-boss-sacked-vegan-porn-films-onlyfans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Uni boss, 63, sacked for starring in vegan-themed porn films in Only Fans side hustle">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kyle-trask.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kyle Trask">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
