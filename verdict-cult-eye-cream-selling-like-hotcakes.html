I haven’t seen these kinds of results with anything I’ve tried in the past," she said.</p><p>“It feels silky smooth to put on, too. Some creams sit on top of your skin, but this one soaks right in, it’s not oily and does a great job.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Ceri claimed the product cured her milia, a skin condition she is prone to.</p><p><a href=#>Milia</a> are small white spots caused by trapped dead skin cells which form cysts below the surface of the skin. They are most often seen on the skin around the cheeks, nose, eyes and eyelids, forehead and chest, according to <a href=#>Patient</a>.</p><p>Ceri has battled various skin issues over the years. As the counsellor suffered from <a href=#>acne</a> from a young age, she said she has always paid close attention to her skin.</p><p>She said: “As I got older, my skin texture was changing and as I approached my 40s, I found my skin was dehydrated in some areas, but also combination."</p><p>But she said the eye serum had hydrated and plumped her skin in that area.</p><p>“Before I started using it, I had circles and fine lines, but they’ve really reduced since using the product, and I noticed in only a few days.</p><p>“I’ve spent lots on various products which may have been cheaper, but the results of using this are worth every penny.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the scientists behind Eye Repair, claim it loads the skin with oxygen and scavenges excess CO2 to convert into more oxygen.</p><p>“Oxygen is the skin’s turbo repair system,” explained founder, Richard Mears.</p><p>"If you sprain your ankle, you might be advised to put ice on it. The ice makes the skin cold, and the body reacts by sending more blood to the area.</p><p>“Blood brings oxygen, which is why elite athletes sit in ice baths and sleep in oxygen tents – it’s the same principal.”</p><p>Richard explained the top FIVE mistakes people make when choosing a skincare product.</p><h2>1. Not knowing your skin type</h2><p>According to Richard, surveys have shown around 63 per cent of women do not know or understand their own skin type, and or navigate their way through the offerings based on skin type.</p><p>Most brands have a variety of products and unless you understand the list of what it contains you cannot correctly understand the benefits of the product for your own skin.</p><h2>2. Falling for the hype</h2><p>‘Clinically proven’ is great provided it tells you clearly what it is clinically proven to do, Richard went on.</p><p>"Technically you could put clinically proven on a box even if the product is clinically proven not to do anything. Fewer products than you think actually undergo independent clinical tests as a finished product."</p><p>He said many products rely on ingredient stories, for example, ‘vitamin C is proven to energise and brighten skin and help protect against age spots.</p><p>"So the product contains Vitamin C, but how much? Is it enough to have a significant effect?" Richard asked.</p><h2>3. Not paying attention to wording</h2><p>Not reading the label or the box correctly trips people up all the time, according to Richard.</p><p>He advised you read it 'like a lawyer'.</p><p>"If it says ‘helps’ or repeatedly talks about the ingredients then they aren’t confident enough to make any promises."</p><h2>4. Believing you get what you pay for</h2><p>CULT51's founder said: "Don’t make the mistake of believing just because something costs more than similar products that it’s automatically the best version in the field. It doesn’t."</p><h2>5. Judging a book by its cover</h2><p>Finally Richard advised you shouldn't buy a product based on its look or fragrance.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Most brands spend significant money on these things which is not a bad thing provided that the same attention and investment goes into the contents," he explained.</p><p>"If you’re looking for say hydration, wrinkle reduction, skin firmness increase, brightening of complexion, the box and the fragrance are inconsequential."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newspress-collage-22520314-1685456812051.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzfpRrZ2xpZGTDpr7DopqtZZOqubV5xLKcZpuimq6uedKeo6Whnpx6rbXKnmShp6SYrqyx0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fverdict-cult-eye-cream-selling-like-hotcakes.html&text=We%20tested%20the%20world%27s%20%27most%20expensive%27%20eye%20cream%20which%20is%20selling%20like%20hotcakes%20-%20here%27s%20our%20verdict&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fverdict-cult-eye-cream-selling-like-hotcakes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fverdict-cult-eye-cream-selling-like-hotcakes.html&title=We%20tested%20the%20world%27s%20%27most%20expensive%27%20eye%20cream%20which%20is%20selling%20like%20hotcakes%20-%20here%27s%20our%20verdict" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fverdict-cult-eye-cream-selling-like-hotcakes.html&title=We%20tested%20the%20world%27s%20%27most%20expensive%27%20eye%20cream%20which%20is%20selling%20like%20hotcakes%20-%20here%27s%20our%20verdict" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fverdict-cult-eye-cream-selling-like-hotcakes.html&title=We%20tested%20the%20world%27s%20%27most%20expensive%27%20eye%20cream%20which%20is%20selling%20like%20hotcakes%20-%20here%27s%20our%20verdict" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fverdict-cult-eye-cream-selling-like-hotcakes.html&description=We%20tested%20the%20world%27s%20%27most%20expensive%27%20eye%20cream%20which%20is%20selling%20like%20hotcakes%20-%20here%27s%20our%20verdict" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wisconsin-state-quarter-extra-leaf-high-low.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the Wisconsin state quarter with an extra leaf explained - and what makes the coin worth up ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./toby-turner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Toby Turner">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
