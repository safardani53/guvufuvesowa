We've included our expert's ratings and reader ratings. We also want to know which of these saloons you think is the best. So get voting, and we'll print the results in Sun Motors in the coming weeks.</p><h4>BMW 5-Series</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2464-thumb.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>4.5/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Sporty looks and involving handling</li><li>Turbine smooth and economical engines</li><li>Quality cabin</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Some buyers are flash Harrys</li><li>Getting quite common</li><li>Recent turbocharged engines have less character</li></ul><p>BMW has worked so hard honing and refining its 5-Series saloon it has become the definitive sporty executive saloon.</p><p>Some have been slow, lumbered by engines too feeble for the car’s size but on empty twisty road remained great to drive.</p><p>Improved engine technology means a post 2007 car is best choice. M Sport trim is most popular - and most expensive - but the car rides more stiffly.</p><p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Windscreens tend to pick up stone chips, power steering systems can leak and watch out for automatic transmissions that thunk or jolt when moving from neutral. Rear shock absorber mountings are weak and can fail if you hit too many pot holes or speed bumps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/motors_banner_valuations.jpg><h4>Jaguar XF</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2647-thumb.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>4/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Put new life into the Jaguar brand</li><li>Smooth motorway transport</li><li>Reliability and dealers improving</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Styling like a lot of cars except from front</li><li>Drops value quickly from new</li><li>2.2 diesel didn’t arrive until 2012 - four years after car launched</li></ul><p>Jaguar broke its retro-image with the XF but from some angles there is a lot of Ford Mondeo about it and not enough identity.</p><p>Cabin has gimmicky motorised air vents and gear selector knob. Car information and satellite navigation screen has always looked dated. Software known to crash.</p><p>As usual with a Jaguar rear head and legroom isn’t great and early cars suffered electrical glitches.</p><p>Diesel power is the way to go because of better used values unless you plan to run the car into the ground, but don’t expect brilliant fuel economy.</p><p>The 2.2 litre is rough and its 37mpg can be matched by the nicer 2.7 litre.</p><p><strong>What to watch out for: F</strong>uel pump problems can cause cars to go into limp home mode and hard used cars prone to destroying their rear brakes and suspension bushes expensively.</p><h4>Mazda 6</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2605-thumb.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>4/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Sharp, distinctive looks</li><li>Sharp to drive too</li><li>Good economy potential</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Engines could be quieter</li><li>Confusing media/car information system</li><li>Cabin bit cheap in places</li></ul><p>Saloons tend to be dull looking but the Mazda 6’s near coupe-like curves give it style and presence.</p><p>The second generation sold from 2007 to 2012 (face-lifted 2010) also impressed for its engine, especially the diesel which is available with 148bhp or 163bhp.</p><p>For most journeys the lower powered diesel is the better companion than the rather noisy 143 or 165bhp petrol motor.</p><p>With less weight in the nose the petrol cars handle better.</p><p>All models ride firmly and the Sport versions are jittery over poor surfaces.</p><p>If you are looking for reliability this is where to put your money. Spares can be pricey though.</p><p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Brake discs, minor electrical gremlins, some water leaks.</p><h4>Skoda Superb</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/skodasuperb-1000x667.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>4/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Amazing space and equipment levels for the money</li><li>Comfortable and quiet</li><li>Economical</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Might not impress the neighbours</li><li>Watch out for oil pump problems on PD engines</li><li>Needs rear parking sensors</li></ul><p>If you are looking for a big family car with Audi and Volkswagen quality then take a look at the Skoda Superb. Its name comes from a highly-advanced-for-its-time 1934 model that had four-wheel drive and a V8 engine.</p><p>Today’s Superb offers a wide choice of petrol and diesel engines. The first generation of the car was from 2002 to 2008, was based on a lengthened VW Passat chassis. The Czech car actually rode more comfortably on UK roads.</p><p>Best engine choice for generation II is the 123bhp 1.4 and 158bhp 1.8 petrol or for high mileage drivers the 103bhp 1.6 or 138bhp 2-litre diesel. All engines are turbocharged.</p><p>An unusual feature of the car is that the boot can be opened like normal or as a tailgate with the lid attached to the rear window.</p><p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> Superb scores excellent reliability ratings but watch out for worn rubber gaiters letting water on to the constant velocity joints on the axles.</p><h4>Audi A6</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/audia6saloon-1000x667.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>4/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Looks and feels so solid</li><li>Best cabin ambience this side of a Bentley</li><li>Option of four-wheel drive</li></ul><p>The No So Good</p><ul><li>Power steering doesn’t give much feel of what's happening</li><li>Some rivals more involving to drive</li></ul><p>Audi is rightly renowned for its all-wheel drive Quattro models, originally proven in the tough world of international rallying, but for most people front-wheel drive is fine though recent winters may have given some second thoughts.</p><p>The previous generation of the family sized A6 lasted from 2004 to 2011 with a mid-term minor facelift.</p><p>The car was available with a choice of drive and gearbox options and a large range of petrol and diesel engines which were uprated and changed over the years.</p><p>Fuel efficiency is excellent but Audis are premium cars so servicing bills will not be low.<br>Most of the engines have chain driven camshafts but the 2-litre petrol and diesel ones used belts which need checking during service and replacing before 75,000 miles. Budget £550.</p><p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> As ever, dual mass flywheels need checking. They can break up causing clutch failure.</p><h4>Mercedes-Benz E-Class</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2639-thumb.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>4/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Comfortable and very safe</li><li>Good fuel economy</li><li>Engineering integrity</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Too much engine and wind noise at times</li><li>Driving experience feels a bit remote</li><li>It’s Germany’s most popular taxi</li></ul><p>While some cars inspire drivers to give them a thrashing the Mercedes E-Class is designed to deliver you safe and relaxed after your journey.</p><p>Switch to direct-injection engines in 2009 with latest generation range saw fuel consumption improvements of nearly 25%.</p><p>E200CDI or E220CDI engines best choice for drivers covering mixed routes but not that quiet or smooth sounding if you open a window. Expect 42 to 52mpg.</p><p>In 2005 in common with other German car makers Mercedes experienced fuel injectors failing.</p><p>Mercedes quality dropped from around 1997 to 2005/07 but seems to be back to a high standard again, though in 2011/12 in common with other German car makers it experienced fuel injectors failing on the 250CDI diesel engine.</p><p>Servicing costs depend on use and local dealer prices. Official dealers might not be as pricey as you expect.</p><h4>Ford Mondeo</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/4904-thumb.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>3.5/5</span></p><p>THE GOOD</p><ul><li>Good value</li><li>Loves corners</li><li>Massive space</li></ul><p>THE NOT SO GOOD</p><ul><li>Replacement was due two years ago</li><li>Big to park</li><li>Lacks prestige</li></ul><p>From 2007 to 2010 Ford’s spacious Mondeo was available as a saloon as well as a hatch.</p><p>Boot access is less easy but the car looks more upmarket and the greater body rigidity gives it even sharper handling.</p><p>Build quality is a match for German cars like the Mercedes C-Class so used prices are a reflection of image not substance.</p><p>The Mondeo is a superb family car with a supple ride than makes long distances dissolve.</p><p>Don’t go smaller than a 1.8 litre diesel engine. For most drivers the 2-litre is wisest choice.<br>Both the 1.6 and 2-litre Ecoboost petrol engines deliver brisk performance with good thirst, but in all cases stay with manual gearboxes as the automatics hit fuel economy.</p><h4>Vauxhall Insignia</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2171-thumb.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>3.5/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Great looker</li><li>Cheap to buy and run</li><li>Boot opening size not great</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Some cheap materials and creaky software</li><li>Reliability could be better</li></ul><p>The swish styling of the Insignia has helped Vauxhall’s image no end and it is a good car to boot.</p><p>It’s vastly better than the Vectra it replaced and more of a cruiser than the sportier Mondeo.</p><p>If you do the miles to justify diesel, the 2-litre 160bhp is the engine to go for, though it’s noisy at times. You should get 50-55mpg.&nbsp;<span>Petrol? Try the 1.4 Turbo.</span></p><p>The market has reacted well to the Insignia so used prices are not as far below the German trio as they used to be.</p><p><strong>What to watch out for:</strong> Dual mass flywheel (which gives smooth gear changes) and clutch failures. Rear brake discs can bind. Leaking power steering fluid which can be a fire risk.</p><h4>Volkswagen Passat</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/passat-gte-header-28-620x413.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>3.5/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>Classy looks and spacious</li><li>Real mileage muncher</li><li>2-litre turbo diesel exceptionally economical</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Seats lack sufficient back support</li><li>Not as reliable as you might expect</li><li>Handling a bit numb</li></ul><p>Clean, businesslike styling and an upmarket quality image brought sales success for the previous generation Passat (2005 to 2010).</p><p>Soft riding with a comfy, spacious interior and large boot, the Passat is all you would expect the Golf’s big brother to be.</p><p>Size makes reversing tricky unless parking sensors are fitted.</p><p>Car feels underpowered with 1.6 litre petrol engines, but turbo diesels have some reliability issues.</p><p>Earlier TDI turbo diesel engines are raucous under load but have plenty of power for safe overtaking and deliver good fuel figures.</p><p><strong>What to watch out for:</strong> Check fuel injectors which can fail on common rail fuelled engines stopping the car. On PD (pumpe duse) engines servicing must be meticulous. Rattling when you back off the power suggests fly wheel may need replacement.</p><h4>Volvo S80</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/volvos803-1000x667.jpg><p>Sun rating: <span>3.5/5</span></p><p>The Good</p><ul><li>As sensible as a Mercedes</li><li>Good reliability record</li><li>Great for long distance motorway hauls</li></ul><p>The Not So Good</p><ul><li>Exterior not as stylish as the interior</li><li>Engines and gearboxes sometimes don’t seem on speaking terms</li></ul><p>Even restyled with new front and rear bumpers the Volvo S80 is understated looking compared to the usual German metal.</p><p>The cabin is Scandinavian stylish and spacious with really comfortable seats but some fiddly and difficult to learn minor controls.</p><p>This 2nd generation car debuted back in 2006. As usual it is not considered ‘sexy” by the media which tends to under-rate safety features which are a linchpin of Volvo philosophy.</p><p>Engine choice is from three turbo diesels, 1.6, 2.0 or 2.4 litres The smaller engines offer excellent fuel economy when cruising.</p><p><strong>Watch out for:</strong> S80s cope well with huge mileages, but replace camshaft belt every four years/60,000 miles.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More Motors</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgZZwaG5vX6yybr7Er6Cer12ptaZ506inZmlgYsCiuM6opaxn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwe-review-the-top-10-saloons.html&text=We%20review%20the%20Top%2010%20Saloons&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwe-review-the-top-10-saloons.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwe-review-the-top-10-saloons.html&title=We%20review%20the%20Top%2010%20Saloons" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwe-review-the-top-10-saloons.html&title=We%20review%20the%20Top%2010%20Saloons" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwe-review-the-top-10-saloons.html&title=We%20review%20the%20Top%2010%20Saloons" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwe-review-the-top-10-saloons.html&description=We%20review%20the%20Top%2010%20Saloons" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bernard-kerrs-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Bernard Kerr Dating  Bernard Kerr's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maika-monroe-significant-other-movie-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maika Monroe Talks Significant Other Movie With Jake Lacy: Exclusive  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
