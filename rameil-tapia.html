Out of 27%, Raimel comes from a beautiful country, the Dominican Republic, which is a Caribbean nation, situated two hours south of Miami and almost four hours away from New York.</p><p>Moreover, the Dominican Republic is famous for tourism consisting of exotic beaches, resorts, and golfing locations.</p><p>The talented outfielder Tapia brings cultural variation to MLB, but he plays baseball with the same passion as everyone else.</p><h2>Raimel Tapia | Age| Weight | Height | Horoscope</h2><p>The baseball star, Raimel, was born on February 4, 1994, in San Pedro De Macoris, Dominican Republic. Raimel is 29 years old, stands 6 feet and 2 inches tall, and weighs around 73 kg.</p><p>Being born on the 4th of February makes Tapia an Aquarius. The Aquarians are usually progressive and intelligent people. They are unique and romantic also.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Raimel-Tapia-new-1024x672.jpg><p>Furthermore, Tapia is Rooster in Chinese Astrology. Roosters are playful and amusing personalities. Often they are honest and loyal to their loved ones.</p><h2>Tapia | Family | Personal Life | Hobbies</h2><p>Raimel says he grew up watching his brothers play; watching them play motivated Tapia to become a baseball player.</p><p>There is not much written about his parents or brothers. The rising star considers&nbsp;<strong>Alfonso Soriano</strong>&nbsp;his ideal, whom he admires and who supports him.</p><h3>&nbsp;Who is Alfonso Soriano?</h3><p>Alfonso Soriano is a former baseball player. The Dominican-born star played baseball for the New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs, and Washington Nationals.</p><p>With 412 career home runs, Alfonso had secured 53rd place on the all-time list when he retired in November 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Alfonso-Soriano-1024x683.jpg><p>Moreover, Tapia comes from a family where they have played baseball before. He thinks that they already know what; it is like to be a baseball player; they know what it takes to become a professional baseball player.</p><h4><a href=# rel=noopener><i>Brian Goodwin Bio: Early Life, Career, Net Worth & Social Media >></i></a></h4><p>In addition to a few mentions about his family, Tapia said that his brother and brother’s girlfriend helped him in his hard times.</p><p>You may want to read about another MLB star, <a href=#>Brian Goodwin</a>.</p><h3>Favorite Food</h3><p>In one of the interviews, Tapia talked about cooking and his favorite food. He said that he is not that good cook yet.</p><p>Further, Raimel said that he likes to eat cooked food and his favorite food is Locrio, which is rice mixed with pork.</p><h3>Hobbies</h3><p>The superb outfielder, Tapia, not only plays basketball, he is an enthusiastic farmer. He has a farm where he has domesticated a lot of animals. Raimel likes to take care of them.</p><p>Moreover, Tapia enjoys fishing during his leisure time. He likes being out in nature.</p><p>Similarly, Raimel likes&nbsp;<strong>Lapiz</strong> music, as he sings, referring to the Bible and real life. His favorite song is ‘Atento A Mi 10’, sung by Lapiz.</p><h3>Tapia | Wife | Girlfriend</h3><p>Raimel is probably not married yet. Tapia, the baseball star, is young, handsome, and successful, but there is no history of his dating.</p><p>Either he is too focused on his career, or he is hiding his special someone. Anything can be right, but we cannot say anything until we know it.</p><p>Moreover, Raimel’s female fans must be waiting to sneak into his personal affairs. A little hint from Tapia can make a huge difference for all of his fans.</p><h2>&nbsp;Raimel Tapia | Career</h2><p>Raimel Tapia is a simple guy from the Dominican Republic who probably would never think of playing for the MLB, but he had a number of people who inspired him to be what he is today.</p><p>Watching his brothers playing a foreign game and achieving success had sowed dreams in his mind early on.</p><p>Tapia started his professional career as a free agent in 2010 with the Colorado Rockies. In 2013, Raimel played with the Grand Junction Rockies and won the title of the league’s player of July.</p><p>In addition to Raimel’s first few titles, he was named the #97 prospect in baseball by Baseball Prospectus.</p><p>Moreover, the Rockies put him on their 40-man roster after the 2015 season.<br>Again, Tapia started the 2016 season with the Hartford Yard Goats of the Class AA Eastern League.</p><p>He was then promoted to the Albuquerque Isotopes of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League by the Rockies.</p><p>Eventually, Raimel made it to the Major Leagues in September 2016. He did not taste major success until 2018, when he hit a two-out, two-strike, and go-ahead pinch grand slam against Arizona Diamondbacks.</p><p>It led to a win for the Rockies with 11-10.</p><h4><a href=# rel=noopener>Jason Castro Bio: Age, Family, Wife Career & Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Raimel continued to improve his craft in later years. He looks prepared for more challenges in later years than earlier.</p><p>Moreover, 2020 turned out to be a good year for Raimel as he got more playing time after <a href=#>Ian Desmond</a> withdrew due to the Pandemic.</p><p>He successfully hit .321, <a href=#>scored</a> 17 runs, and got eight bases in a total of 51 games.</p><p>Looking at his baseball history, we are likely to see Raimel playing more and touching greater success horizons in the upcoming years.</p><h3>MLB Statistics</h3><h3>Social Work</h3><p>Recently, Raimel, one of the fastest baseball players of the Colorado Rockies, has helped out people from his hometown in San Pedro de Macoris during the Covid pandemic.</p><p>He donated a large number of supplies to almost 150 families.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Raimel-helping-out-during-pandemic-in-the-Dominican-Republic.png><p>Moreover, Tapia says that he wants to help others genuinely. He thinks everyone needs help at difficult times. His heart was broken when he realized that people in his hometown did not have food to eat.</p><h2>Tapia | Net Worth</h2><p>Playing in the Major Leagues pays off well for most baseball players. Some players make millions of dollars a year, and some others settle for less. If talking about Tapia, he is doing well.</p><p>Raimel Tapia has an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p>With determination and hard work, the young star will likely add more to his name and net worth in the future.<br>The MLB star, Raimel, has won many hearts with his simplicity and his dedication to his game.</p><h2>Is Tapia on Social Media?</h2><p>Tapia is active on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, but his Instagram account is private. We definitely would like to see his account be public. Further, he has used Twitter mostly for professional use.</p><p>He has various baseball-related posts on Twitter. There are a few of his videos with his farm animals.</p><p>Similarly, on Facebook, Tapia has posts related to his friends from his hometown and having good times with his loved ones.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> 3279 followers/77 followings</p><p><a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;17.3k followers/267 followings</p><p>Rimel’s fans would love to know more about his personal life and professional updates on social platforms.</p><h2>Recent Updates on Injury</h2><p>Tapia felt a left-hand contusion after his second at-bat in St. Louis in August 2019.</p><p>Raimel Tapia exited the game with an injury after crashing into the wall trying to rob Zach McKinstry of a home run on April 3, 2021.</p><p>Tapia was out of the starting lineup once again on 19 July 2021, which takes him out of the lineup for four straight games, but he can pinch hit in the coming days if needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The reason is not anything, but he was not feeling well at the moment. He has had just one at-bat this series and playing slowly with a slight catch.</p><p>These were just the injuries, but then as of now, thankfully, Tapia hasn’t caught any severe damage that requires any surgery to date.</p><h2>Common Questions about Tapia</h2><h3>Is Raimel related to Alfonso Soriano?</h3><p>Not sure. Raimel has mentioned in a few of his interviews that Alfonso Soriano is his brother and Soriano is supportive of his career, but it is hard to tell if they are blood-related.</p><p>We are likely to find more about their relationship only if Raimel posts something that says they are related.</p><h3>Is Tapia dating anyone?</h3><p>Not sure. Tapia has not talked about his personal affair. Hence, there is no concrete proof of whether he is dating or not.</p><p>Well, Tapia has kept his Instagram private; there might be something who knows; it is hidden for now.</p><p>His social platforms posts also do not give any clue about his dating history. Tapia’s fans and followers will love to know if he is seeing anyone.</p><h3>Is Raimel an American?</h3><p>No. Raimel was born in the Dominican Republic, which is not a part of the United States. She shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.</p><p>There are many famous Dominican baseball players in the MLB.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC%2BwKacoqRdqa6xtcBo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frameil-tapia.html&text=Raimel%20Tapia%20%5b2024%20Update%5d%3a%20Baseball%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frameil-tapia.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frameil-tapia.html&title=Raimel%20Tapia%20%5b2024%20Update%5d%3a%20Baseball%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frameil-tapia.html&title=Raimel%20Tapia%20%5b2024%20Update%5d%3a%20Baseball%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frameil-tapia.html&title=Raimel%20Tapia%20%5b2024%20Update%5d%3a%20Baseball%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frameil-tapia.html&description=Raimel%20Tapia%20%5b2024%20Update%5d%3a%20Baseball%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ryan-stiles-wife-patricia-mcdonald.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan Stiles And Wife Patricia McDonalds Secret Married Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./polly-tsai.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Polly Tsai- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
