The actress <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed her first child</a> with Macaulay, a son named <strong>Dakota</strong>, on Apr. 5, 2021, and since then, all eyes have been on her. She kept both pregnancies under wraps.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Fans may know Brenda as London Tipton in the hit Disney Channel series<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Suite Life of Zack & Cody</a>,&nbsp;which aired from 2005 to 2008, and its spinoff, The Suite Life On Deck, which aired until 2011. She also starred in a series of early Disney films, such as Stuck in the Suburbs (2004) and Get a Clue (2002). Read on to learn more about the former teen star and former child star Macaulay Culkin’s fiancé, Brenda Song.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Who-is-Brenda-Song-Macaulay-Culkin-girlfriend-backgrid-post.jpg><h2>Brenda Song Was Discovered At A Mall</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Brenda wanted to be in the spotlight before she could talk in complete sentences, she revealed in a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>W magazine</a>. She was discovered by an agent during a family trip to Sacramento’s Arden Fair Mall, where she was practicing her catwalk as she watched a model search event happening, in which she was too young to participate. “I was watching and doing the runway walk, and someone came up to my mom,” she recalled. “We were very, very poor. We had no money. My mom was still in school, my dad was in college to be a schoolteacher. We got all the info and my mom was like, ‘Okay, great…’ but that was all I could talk about forever.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“About a month later I got really, really sick and I wouldn’t take my Robitussin. My mom was like, okay fine if you take your Robitussin, we’ll take you to this acting school,” she continued. “I took it, and my grandma was like, ‘We have to take her’ but my mom was like, ‘No, we don’t. She’s a child, she’s not going to remember this.’ I wouldn’t stop bugging them. So my grandma took everything out of her savings, which was $523, and took me to this acting school that was not legit at all, but through them I met a real agent and started auditioning.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Who-is-Brenda-Song-Macaulay-Culkin-girlfriend-shutterstock-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In addition to the above-mentioned Disney shows and films, Brenda appeared in popular Disney shows like Phil of the Future, That’s So Raven, and Hannah Montana. Before making it big on Disney, she had a recurring role in Nickelodeon’s 100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd,&nbsp;which aired from 1999 to 2022. In her adult life, she acted in the television series Dads from 2013 to 2014, Hulu’s comedy series, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dollface</a>, from 2019 to 2022, and she lent her voice to Disney’s Amphibia from 2019 to 2022.</p><h2>Brenda Song Is A College Graduate</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Brenda turned down an acceptance to Harvard University to star in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, according to her interview with W, but eventually made it to college. She attended the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in 2009 after studying psychology and business, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Californian</a>.</p><h2>Who Did Brenda Date Before Macaulay?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Brenda was in an on-again, off-again relationship <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with musician <strong>Trace Cyrus</strong></a>, 34, from 2010 until 2017 and was even engaged to him from 2011 until 2012. Their relationship is memorable due to the confusing pregnancy rumors that occurred in 2011. She allegedly pretended to be pregnant, and her mom spoke out about the issue in a statement to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Radar Online </a>at the time. “She’s actually not pregnant,” <strong>Mai Song</strong> told the outlet. “It’s very upsetting to our family because of what I’m going through and it’s not how we raised her,” her mother, who was undergoing cancer treatments, added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Trace later accused his former girlfriend of making up the pregnancy rumor herself, per screenshots shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Just Jared</a>. Trace is the son of country singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Billy Ray Cyrus </strong></a>and the brother of singers<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Miley Cyrus</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Noah Cyrus</strong></a>.</p><h2>How Did Brenda And Macaulay Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Brenda and the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Home Alone</a> star met in Thailand while on the set of their film Changeland, which was directed by Mack’s longtime friend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Seth Green</strong></a>. They started dating in 2017 and it wasn’t long before they moved in together and began wearing matching pajamas to represent their love, as seen above. Brenda and Macaulay filled their home with pets, per a 2020 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Esquire </a>report. “Song bakes bread—she was baking bread long before the pandemic. They have animals: three cats (the youngest is one he got her for Christmas 2019, named <strong>Santa</strong>), a few fish, a Shiba Inu, and a blue-headed pionus, which is a parrot,” the outlet shared.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Following their engagement in Jan. 2022, a source revealed the pair were in complete bliss over the life they created together. “Macaulay and Brenda have loved being together as a family since welcoming Dakota,” the insider told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>at the time. “The engagement is the natural next step for them. They are excited for their future together.”</p><h2>Breda Song Is An Animal Lover</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Brenda song has posted at least twice about the San Diego Zoo Safari Park on Instagram to commend them for their wildlife conservation efforts. “We had such a life changing experience at @sdzsafaripark this past week. We also learned so much- I feel so inspired,” she began in the caption of a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>carousel of photos</a> of herself enjoying her time at the non-profit zoo in May 2022. “Thank you to the incredible team at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance for working tirelessly to raise awareness about environmental issues while protecting wildlife here in San Diego, and around the world. Thank you, thank you @sdzsafaripark for all that you guys are doing and for having us! #sdzsafaripark #wildlifeallies”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kvs7HNnZhmq5%2BjtG6twq2pnqujYoF1fJFucHJn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-brenda-song-actress-4402599.html&text=Who%20Is%20Brenda%20Song%3f%20Five%20Things%20About%20The%20Actress%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-brenda-song-actress-4402599.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brenda-song-actress-4402599.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brenda%20Song%3f%20Five%20Things%20About%20The%20Actress%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-brenda-song-actress-4402599.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brenda%20Song%3f%20Five%20Things%20About%20The%20Actress%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-brenda-song-actress-4402599.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brenda%20Song%3f%20Five%20Things%20About%20The%20Actress%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-brenda-song-actress-4402599.html&description=Who%20Is%20Brenda%20Song%3f%20Five%20Things%20About%20The%20Actress%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brides-rush-buy-hen-do-wedding-range-quiz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'I cant get over these bags' - Brides rush to buy new hen do and wedding accessories in Quiz">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./justin-bieber-rihanna-hooked-up-friends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About The Affair  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
