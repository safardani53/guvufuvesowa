Daydreaming, looking up at the sky and wondering about what life could be.</p><p>"That’s as true to me now as it was in the early ’90s. Growing up in poverty and unemployment, music took me out of that.”</p><p>The album, recorded at Noel’s new North London studio, which he kindly showed me around last summer, lands on June 2, followed by UK tour dates which will see Noel back to what he does best after a turbulent period in his life.</p><p>Last weekend I revealed the sad news that he and his wife <a href=#>Sara Macdonald</a> are to <a href=#>divorce after 22 years together</a>. Noel wasn’t wearing his wedding ring during filming.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>The surprising break-up also appeared to prompt a response from estranged brother and Oasis frontman <a href=#>Liam Gallagher,</a> who posted a series of cryptic messages on social media including a link to The Hollies’ classic song He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother.</p><p>Insiders have speculated that Noel’s split could mean an Oasis reunion. But it sounds like Noel is going to have his hands full for this year at least.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/noel-gallagher-spotted-filming-new-788966300.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/noel-gallagher-spotted-filming-new-788960705.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>BLUE-TY QUEEN MARGOT</h2><p><a href=#>MARGOT ROBBIE</a> wore this dress on Blue Monday and it certainly cheered me up.</p><p>The Aussie looked sensational at the Sydney premiere for her latest movie Babylon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/41692250-6253-4bc6-b24f-bbbe942a8366.jpg><p>And I’m not the only one who thought so. The actress practically shut down an entire road as she met fans.</p><p>It has been 15 years since she launched her career playing <a href=#>Donna Freedman</a> in <a href=#>Neighbours</a> and she is now one of Hollywood’s most in-demand stars.</p><p>In July she will star in the big-budget Barbie movie, having already started filming a prequel to Ocean’s Eleven.</p><p>There is also talk of her directing a spin-off of the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies. There’s no stopping her.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Race is on for Andrew</h2><p><a href=#>ANDREW GARFIELD</a> has told how he is keen to return to <a href=#>RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> UK after his first appearance went down a storm with fans.</p><p>The Amazing Spider-Man actor, who sat alongside Alan Carr and <a href=#>Michelle Visage</a> on the panel in 2019, revealed he loved every second.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/andrew-garfield-attends-28th-annual-788939338.jpg><p>In an exclusive chat, he said: “I’d love to go back on as a judge, absolutely. And I would love to get in drag.</p><p>"But I wouldn’t get in drag on the show. It’s the queens’ time to shine – it’s not about me.”</p><p>If you say so, Andrew. The two-time Oscar-nominated actor is a huge fan of the programme, and I have no doubt the <a href=#>Beeb</a> will be clamouring to book him for the next series.</p><p>He has been quizzed a number of times about his dedication to Drag Race – and at last year’s Academy Awards, he revealed who his character would be if he had a chance to compete on the show’s Blankety Blank-style contest Snatch Game.</p><p>Andrew said: “<a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>. Why not? Let’s give it a try. She’s hilarious.”</p><p><a href=#>JO O’MEARA</a> stayed tight-lipped when quizzed about rumours <a href=#>S Club 7</a> are reuniting for a new tour.</p><p>She was on <a href=#>ITV</a>’s <a href=#>Loose Women</a> yesterday and refused to confirm whether the Noughties favourites, also including <a href=#>Rachel Stevens</a>, <a href=#>Paul Cattermole</a>, <a href=#>Hannah Spearritt</a>, <a href=#>Bradley McIntosh</a>, <a href=#>Tina Barrett</a> and <a href=#>Jon Lee</a>, would be getting back together.</p><p>She said: “I would love to. We all do still speak. Getting the seven of us together at the same time, it’s quite tough. But you never know.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Big C Andy: I’ll live life</h2><p><a href=#>DURAN DURAN</a> guitarist <a href=#>Andy Taylor</a> said he is determined to live life to the full following his <a href=#>cancer diagnosis</a>.</p><p>The musician was told he had an incurable type of the disease last year.</p><p>Andy said in an interview on <a href=#>Channel 5</a> yesterday: “I’m going to live life. There’s some new treatments that can help me.”</p><p>Speaking about how he threw himself into work following his diagnosis, Andy added: “I’ve made three albums, I went on the road with some friends of mine, the band REEF, and played some shows.</p><p>“I often say to people, every minute’s like an hour, every day’s like a week. You really want to get the most out of life.”</p><p>You’re an inspiration, Andy.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>GEORGE FAMILY NOT PART OF BIOPIC</h2><p><a href=#>GEORGE MICHAEL</a>’s estate has denied any involvement in a biopic believed to be in the pipeline about the late singer.</p><p>It was revealed at the weekend that a film is in the works with White Lotus heart-throb <a href=#>Theo James</a> being considered to play the <a href=#>Wham!</a> superstar, who died in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/george-michael-attends-press-conference-74901700.jpg><p>Insiders claimed the project had an £85million budget and was nearing the end of its development process.</p><p>But yesterday George Michael Entertainment said: “To all of George’s Lovelies, fans and lovers of his music, a story has been pub lished stating that George Michael’s family has en- dorsed a so-called biopic about his life.</p><p>"On behalf of George’s family and GME, we want to make it clear that there is no truth whatsoever in this story, we know nothing about this project and will not be endorsing it in any way.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Steven’s tears as he sees ‘mom and dad’</h2><p><a href=#>STEVEN SPIELBERG</a> has told how he broke down in tears during the making of his new film The Fabelmans.</p><p>They flowed when he saw <a href=#>Michelle Williams</a> and <a href=#>Paul Dano</a> on set in costume as characters he based on his late parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/steven-spielberg-arrives-afi-awards-788324987.jpg><p>The movie follows a young boy who dreams of being a film-maker amid an upbringing in a dysfunctional family.</p><p>The legendary director of Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and E.T. among countless other block- busters, told the SmartLess podcast: “I told the cast before we started shooting that I had got all of my emotion out writing the script with Tony Kushner.</p><p>“I thought I had got over the hardest part of telling this story by telling this story on paper.</p><p>"Then on the first day of shooting, Michelle Williams and Paul Dano, playing Burt and Mitzi, or my parents, they came out.</p><p>“I turned around and I looked at them together...and I completely lost it.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ON OLLY-DAY</h2><p><a href=#>OLLY MURS</a> made sure everyone knew his fiancee was a taken woman while on holiday – after giving her a garish swimsuit with his face printed on it.</p><p>Sharing this snap of city worker <a href=#>Amelia Tank</a> on Instagram, he wrote: “On holiday I got Amelia a new beach outfit!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/olly-murs-fianc-e-amelia-788708236.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/olly-murs-girlfriend-amelia-tank-788896670.jpg><p>"Something low profile...think she loved it.”</p><p>The couple have just returned from a trip to Barbados and Olly said he is looking forward to a jam-packed year.</p><p>He explained: “Our last holiday as Mr and Miss. very exciting 2023 ahead for many reasons: The tour, more music, Starstruck season two, The Voice and of course the wedding!”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>CHERYL STAGE FRIGHT COACH</h2><p>HER acting experience is about as extensive as mine, so it’s little surprise <a href=#>Cheryl Tweedy</a> is getting a helping hand ahead of her stage debut in the <a href=#>West End show 2:22 A Ghost Story</a>.</p><p>Insiders have told me the former <a href=#>Girls Aloud</a> singer has been working with a voice and breathing coach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cheryl-tweedy-ghost-2-22-788964552.jpg><p>A source said: “Cheryl has been having lessons that will help her build vocal and breathing stamina, flexibility and help her control nerves.</p><p>“She is being taught how to connect with her breath to allow the range, volume and pitch of her voice to be free from tension.”</p><p>Luckily for the audience, Cheryl won’t be singing in the production.</p><p>Last year those behind the scenes revealed Cheryl was earning £750,000 from the run of shows which will end in April.
