The two have rarely seen eye to eye in the three seasons that Jennifer has been on the show, and their drama continued throughout Season 11.&nbsp;</p><p>When Margaret shared that she would include an anecdote about how she slept with her boss in her memoir, Caviar Dreams, Tuna Fish Budget: How to Survive in Business and Life, Jennifer was critical.</p><p>Once Margaret read the excerpt out loud to the ladies, Jennifer apologized. However, their issues later intensified again when Margaret said that she was "mortified" by Jennifer's Instagram Live about hiring a housekeeper.</p><p>In the Season 11 finale, Margaret commented on Jennifer's drinking at her Halloween party. The Long Island native told Distractify that she found it "mind-boggling" that her co-star got "mad" that she was having fun at the event.&nbsp;</p><p>Jennifer shared that she did address her ongoing feud with Margaret at the reunion.&nbsp;</p><p>"I have been her target all season, but that's OK. She was pretty much my target at [the] reunion," she teased. "For the most part, we hashed it out."</p><p>To prepare for the two-part special, Jennifer read part of Margaret's book.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>"I started reading her book, actually. I read half of it before the reunion, because I just wanted to know more going into it ... I was intrigued. You want to make yourself seem one way, and maybe it's better if I get the whole picture," Jennifer said. "I always believe that knowledge is power."&nbsp;</p><p>She added that the memoir was "an easy read" and that she "gained some perspective" about her co-star by reading it.&nbsp;</p><p>But, she still believes that her opinion on Margaret is the same.</p><p>"I feel like my perception was pretty on point, and that's all I'll say about that," she continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Though she has yet to finish it, Jennifer "wish[es] her all the best on the book."</p><p>According to the mom of five, her discussions with Margaret are only part of the eventful Season 11 conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was a very explosive reunion," Jennifer shared. "We all had a lot to say, and we all put it out on the table. You'll see how it ends up."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'RHONJ' star dished on her beauty pillow launch and the "nice change" in her marriage.</h2><p>While Jennifer's family life has often been at the forefront of her scenes on the show, she's always been on top of the latest beauty trends. On May 19, the reality star launched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ultimate Beauty Pillow</a>, which provides neck and head support for those who are looking to sleep on their backs.</p><p>The product, she notes, is ideal for people who have had surgical or nonsurgical procedures done (and it helps to prevent wrinkles).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Jennifer worked with her plastic surgeon husband, Bill Aydin, on the pillow.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was just about me being able to create something with my husband together. We're putting something out there on the market that is not available," she said. "There's other beauty pillows that I've seen, but honestly, they look like choking hazards to me."</p><p>In addition to working in business together, Jennifer and Bill are enjoying their time on RHONJ more than ever before. As Season 11 aired, Bill received a lot of love on social media, and he got even more attention after an appearance on the May 5 episode of Watch What Happens Live.</p><p>"He's drinking the Kool-Aid. He's into it now..." Jennifer said about her husband's evolution on the show. "For me, it's a blessing that he is enjoying this journey with me. Before, I was always his support. I was the plastic surgeon's wife, and I was doing everything to appease him. Now, he's been rearranging his schedule and doing things to accommodate me. It's a nice change."</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvusifnKtlka6xqrqMq5%2Bopppiv6bBzaKmp2WjpbyquMSrqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-aydin-rhonj-reunion-spoilers.html&text=Jennifer%20Aydin%20Reveals%20Who%20Her%20%26quot%3bTarget%26quot%3b%20Was%20at%20the%20%26quot%3bExplosive%26quot%3b%20%27RHONJ%27%20Reunion%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-aydin-rhonj-reunion-spoilers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-aydin-rhonj-reunion-spoilers.html&title=Jennifer%20Aydin%20Reveals%20Who%20Her%20%26quot%3bTarget%26quot%3b%20Was%20at%20the%20%26quot%3bExplosive%26quot%3b%20%27RHONJ%27%20Reunion%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjennifer-aydin-rhonj-reunion-spoilers.html&title=Jennifer%20Aydin%20Reveals%20Who%20Her%20%26quot%3bTarget%26quot%3b%20Was%20at%20the%20%26quot%3bExplosive%26quot%3b%20%27RHONJ%27%20Reunion%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-aydin-rhonj-reunion-spoilers.html&title=Jennifer%20Aydin%20Reveals%20Who%20Her%20%26quot%3bTarget%26quot%3b%20Was%20at%20the%20%26quot%3bExplosive%26quot%3b%20%27RHONJ%27%20Reunion%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-aydin-rhonj-reunion-spoilers.html&description=Jennifer%20Aydin%20Reveals%20Who%20Her%20%26quot%3bTarget%26quot%3b%20Was%20at%20the%20%26quot%3bExplosive%26quot%3b%20%27RHONJ%27%20Reunion%20%28EXCLUSIVE%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./maci-bookout-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maci Bookout  Pics Of Teen Mom Star  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./daniel-platzman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daniel Platzman">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
