She is so gracious for going public with her story with @edailypop of @enews . We were lucky enough to be able to do the procedure after she completed filming the current season and before COVID hit in New York. So many celebrities look amazing but do not disclose that they have done #plasticsurgery, but I know that her coming forward will empower women who are considering taking control of their appearance. As you can see from her #faceliftbeforeandafter, a #facelift can look completely natural with my signature #extendedddeepplanefacelift technique with absolutely no tightness because I am lifting the deep musculature and fallen fat pads of the face not pulling on the skin! But I think she looks 15 years younger!!!! At the same time I performed a #necklift with #platysmaplasty to treat laxity and #neckbans. Sonja has such beautiful facial structure, high cheek bones, beautiful jawline, and a long elegant neck. She has the perfect "scaffolding", if you will, so I can give her a gorgeous result. I am humbled that she chose me for her surgery, as she said in her interview her face is her money maker and she would only trust me! I regularly treat celebrities and people whose faces are on camera everyday so I know that the stakes are high. But I know the stakes are high for every woman and man I treat with a facelift, I put my heart and my artistry into EVERY case.
