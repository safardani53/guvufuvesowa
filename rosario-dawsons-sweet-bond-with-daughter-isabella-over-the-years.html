Since she was a little girl, Dawson always <a href=#>dreamed of adopting</a> a child. The actress’ motherhood aspiration was inspired by her own family situation, as she learned at age 5 that her dad was not her biological father.</p><p>“Growing up in the neighborhood that I grew up in, I was like, ‘Oh, so then I could be like some of my friends who have single-parent households. Like, that could be me,’” she exclusively told Us Weekly in December 2018. “So I remember I told my mom at 5 that when I got older I was gonna adopt and I was gonna adopt older.”</p><p>Dawson’s dream came true when she first met Isabella and knew that she was destined to be her daughter.</p><p>“I didn’t go to an adoption center or anything like that,” Dawson said in a February 2021 interview with <a href=#>Health</a> magazine. “My family knew her biological mom, and when we found out she was in foster care, we looked for her. It wasn’t even a question; it was clearly meant to be — she’s my kid.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Dawson and Isabella’s bond over the years:</p><h3>Celebrating Milestones</h3><p>Ahead of Isabella’s sweet sixteen, Dawson reflected on how she cherishes spending those pivotal occasions with her daughter.</p><p>“My daughter is about to have a sweet sixteen, so that’s the birthday we’re talking about in our household — it’s like there is no other birthday, this is the birthday,” she explained to <a href=#>InStyle</a> in February 2019. “I think there are times when you take birthdays for granted, and I really want to take advantage of the fact that reaching 40 in my generation is different than it was for my grandmother and for my mom.”</p><p>She continued: “I don’t know if I’m going to go jump from a helicopter or do a bungee jump, but I want to be out there, celebrate, and be in appreciation of who I get to share this with — and that will be my sweet 16 year old.”</p><h3>Questioning Mom’s Coolness</h3><p>Dawson recalled a time when Isabella had picked out an outfit for her mom to wear to an Oscars after-party. After the actress decided to bail, Isabella was not impressed.</p><p>“I was ready to leave, and then I was just like, ‘Do I really want to go all the way across town?’ I changed into pajamas and my daughter was like, ‘What is wrong with you?’” she said to <a href=#>The Cut</a> in April 2019. “She saw that picture of Madonna with Lady Gaga the day after. She’s like, ‘Your priorities are all screwed up, mom. You have to hang out with Madonna.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rosario-Dawson-Sweet-Bond-With-Daughter-Isabella-Over-the-Years-1.jpg><h3>Becoming a Family</h3><p>In 2021, Dawson opened up about what it was like to welcome Isabella into her home.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“To have a young person move in with you and to have to really consciously work through triggers and that kind of stuff is a really different thing than being pregnant and having your baby grow up in front of you — to be able to see how we’re getting closer and closer,” she explained to Health magazine. “We are a family, and it’s beautiful.”</p><h3>From Mom to Grandma</h3><p>Dawson revealed in December 2023 that <a href=#>Isabella was expecting</a> her first baby. The Ashoka star shared that the news was “very exciting” and she couldn’t wait to become a “Glamma.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarp6OWv6q7jJ2YsKufo8Buv9aenK1lkqS7pXnWoquhZZSWwqi0056pZqGjlq%2BmuMuaZKiulad6tbTEZrCemaKofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frosario-dawsons-sweet-bond-with-daughter-isabella-over-the-years.html&text=Rosario%20Dawsons%20Sweet%20Bond%20With%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Over%20the%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frosario-dawsons-sweet-bond-with-daughter-isabella-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frosario-dawsons-sweet-bond-with-daughter-isabella-over-the-years.html&title=Rosario%20Dawsons%20Sweet%20Bond%20With%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frosario-dawsons-sweet-bond-with-daughter-isabella-over-the-years.html&title=Rosario%20Dawsons%20Sweet%20Bond%20With%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frosario-dawsons-sweet-bond-with-daughter-isabella-over-the-years.html&title=Rosario%20Dawsons%20Sweet%20Bond%20With%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frosario-dawsons-sweet-bond-with-daughter-isabella-over-the-years.html&description=Rosario%20Dawsons%20Sweet%20Bond%20With%20Daughter%20Isabella%20Over%20the%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./p1e0yevk6fk-tbqwscb3zgnqwym7chvy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch All That Season 2 Episode 13: Episode 228">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gerard-gallant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gerard Gallant">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
