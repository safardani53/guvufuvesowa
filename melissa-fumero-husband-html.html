And, much like everyone at the time, she had a crush on David Fumero when the video came out. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But, when she first started dating him, she had no idea who&nbsp;her now husband was, despite having a crush on him for the longest time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Melissa Fumero Didn't Recognize Her Husband</h2><p>Melissa had such a crush on David that&nbsp;she would get angry at the TV when she couldn't see him. David appears right at the end, and she would get mad at MTV when they cut the video short by a few seconds. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, despite having a massive crush on the&nbsp;actor, she did not want to date actors when she came of age. While talking to Steve Harvey in October 2017, she elaborated on this.</p><p>Confessing&nbsp;about her "no date actor rule," Melissa told Harvey, "I did have reservations about dating an actor." But she did not have any particular reason behind it.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Melissa Fumero with her husband David Fumero in April 2020.</strong> (Photo: Melissa Fumero/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So, when she first met David, she was hesitant about going out with him. She knew he was an actor and model but did not yet realize he was THE guy from the video.</p><p>This surprised Harvey, who pressed her on the matter. Melissa, however, reiterated her side of the story. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I didn't know this was the situation I was dealing with," said the <a href=# rel=follow>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a> actress, pointing to the stills from the video being shown to the studio audience behind her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Harvey still couldn't believe that she didn't recognize the man&nbsp;she had had a crush on since she was 13 when she saw him in the flesh.</p><p>The host then further joked about it, asking if her husband had his shirt off when she saw him, to which Melissa could only respond with mumblings. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She realized she was dating her childhood crush during a casual conversation on a date about two&nbsp;months later. David just casually revealed he was in a Mariah Carey video.</p><p>Then it hit her. She asked him, "Were you in the Honey video? Were you at the end, on the beach?" He said yes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Shocked and flustered with the realization, Melissa said she immediately excused herself to the bathroom to regain her composure.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She joked she tried to play it off when she came back from her break by asking, "How was Mariah?" to him.</p><h2>Melissa Fumero's Family with Husband David Fumero</h2><p>Melissa and her husband David <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got married</a> on December 9, 2007. They have now been married for almost 15 years and together for even longer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They now have two kids. The couple welcomed their first kid, son Enzo Fumero, on March&nbsp;24, 2016. When announcing his birth on Instagram, she said Enzo was the "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sweetest face</a>" she had ever held. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In November 2019, she announced she was pregnant for the second. And&nbsp;on February 14, 2020, she and her husband had&nbsp;their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">second son</a>, Axel&nbsp;Fumero. With his arrival, Valentine's Day became her favorite holiday. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Having her two kids was two different kinds of experiences for Melissa. With Enzo, she had her loved ones around. But Axel was a pandemic baby.</p><p>"We had so much support," she told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Parents</a> about adjusting to motherhood when her son arrived. Her parents, in-laws, and friends were all around and pitching in.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, things were different with Axel because as he arrived, the world shut down.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"David and I were completely on our own," Melissa revealed.&nbsp;Adjusting to a family life of four with two kids below two years of age had been "both exhausting and overwhelming."</p><p>The actress grew to like&nbsp;surprises. Even though she and her husband were undecided about having kids, their kids were surprises to them.</p><p>Maybe a third surprise soon? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWVoba0v8Bmna6llae8brTUrJmappRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmelissa-fumero-husband-html.html&text=Melissa%20Fumero%20Didnt%20Realize%20Her%20Husband%20Was%20Her%20Teenage%20Crush&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmelissa-fumero-husband-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmelissa-fumero-husband-html.html&title=Melissa%20Fumero%20Didnt%20Realize%20Her%20Husband%20Was%20Her%20Teenage%20Crush" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmelissa-fumero-husband-html.html&title=Melissa%20Fumero%20Didnt%20Realize%20Her%20Husband%20Was%20Her%20Teenage%20Crush" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmelissa-fumero-husband-html.html&title=Melissa%20Fumero%20Didnt%20Realize%20Her%20Husband%20Was%20Her%20Teenage%20Crush" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmelissa-fumero-husband-html.html&description=Melissa%20Fumero%20Didnt%20Realize%20Her%20Husband%20Was%20Her%20Teenage%20Crush" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./social-security-supplemental-income-updates-2023-benefits-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Social Security Supplemental Income 2023  Millions to see $943 drop in their bank account today -">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./noel-mikaelian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Noel Mikaelian net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
