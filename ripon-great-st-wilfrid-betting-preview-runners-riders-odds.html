Growl - Richard Fahey (8-1)</h3><p>A lot of people's cliff horse, <strong>Growl</strong> is frustrating to follow but has form in Group races and is often people's idea of a good bet in handicap company.</p><p>But in these big fields it's never that simple and<strong> Growl</strong> has not won since picking up a Listed heat towards the end of 2016.</p><p>He's undoubtedly well handicapped and was arguably slightly unlucky at Goodwood and you can't ignore his obvious claims.</p><h3>3. Kimberella - Richard Fahey (10-1)</h3><p>Fahey runs four in the race and according to the bookmakers his next best chance is with the admirable <strong>Kimberella</strong>.</p><p>The eight-year-old drops into a handicap for the first time since February and has picked up Conditions and Listed races since.</p><p>Fahey also runs Brian The Snail and Marie Of Lyon and both are capable horses on a going day.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Richard Fahey on his four hopes</h3></p><p><strong>Kimberella</strong> -&nbsp;"He loves the track, we're taking 7lb off him so we're hoping it will help him. He holds the track record there and we're very happy with him."</p><p><strong>Brian The Snail -&nbsp;</strong><span id=_mce_caret>"He has plenty of ability, but we see more of that than people do at the races."</span></p><p><strong>Growl -&nbsp;</strong>"He's knocking on the door. With slower ground and a bit of luck, he could win one of these."</p><p><strong>Marie Of Lyon -&nbsp;</strong>"She was a little bit unlucky at Goodwood. Things didn't go right for her, but she's in good form."</p><h3>9. Pipers Note - Ruth Carr (10-1)</h3><p>They're won't be a horse running at Ripon this summer that loves the track as much as this horse.</p><p>The veteran has won eight races at the Yorkshire track from eighteen starts and this has ensured he's well found in the market.</p><p>He's hunting the hattrick and steps up in class but has won off higher in the handicap before.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Ruth Carr on Pipers Note</h3></p><p>"He absolutely loves the place. He's won his last two there and I'm really looking forward to it.</p><p>"As he's got older, he's able to handle softer ground better than when he was younger, so fast ground isn't as important as it once was.</p><p>"It was a good performance last time out and I honestly don't know what it is about the place he loves so much.</p><p>"Some horses handle the undulations better than others and he is obviously one of those."</p><h3>8. Golden Apollo - Tim Easterby (10-1)</h3><p><strong>Golden Apollo</strong> would love some cut in the ground and put up his best performance of the season when a narrow second to stablemate <strong>Flying Pursuit</strong> last time out.</p><p>He's gone back up to a mark he struggled off last time but gets the first time cheekpieces and is in better form to when last tackling this mark.</p><p>He'll have a big chance but like the rest will need luck in running at a track that can produce hard luck stories.</p><h3>5. Flying Pursuit - Tim Easterby (12-1)</h3><p>Easterby also runs <strong>Flying Pursuit</strong> who beat <strong>Golden Apollo</strong> in the Sky Bet Dash at York last time out.</p><p>He's up 6lbs for that win but returns to a track he's won at before, which is important at somewhere undulating like Ripon.</p><p>However, last time he ran here he was well beaten by course specialist <strong>Pipers Note</strong>. Saying that he tends to come later in the season and Easterby will have him wound up for this.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Tim Easterby on Flying Pursuit and Golden Apollo</h3></p><p>"They are both in good form. Both want cut in the ground. They both should run well.</p><p>"We can't split them at home, so we'll see."</p><h3>1. Spring Loaded - Paul D'Arcy (11-1)</h3><p><strong>Spring Loaded</strong> has to defy a career-high mark but showed he can still be competitive when finishing strongly to be just out of the places in the Stewards' Cup despite suffering a slight injury.</p><p>He had won his previous race at Ascot in good style and landed the Portland Handicap at Doncaster in tremendous fashion last season.</p><p>He's arguably the class horse in the race with Growl and will take some stopping if getting a clear run.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Paul D'Arcy on Spring Loaded</h3></p><p>"He's come out of Goodwood very well. He got a little injury during the race, but he's over that.</p><p>"Like all sprinters, he needs a lot of luck in running.</p><p>"You need to be where the pace is and where he's drawn, hopefully he'll get sucked into the race and can win for us.</p><p>"He was a very well-handicapped horse when he won the Portland last year. Circumstances as to how the season had gone for him meant he was well-handicapped that day."</p><h3>4. Aeolus - Ed Walker (25-1)</h3><p>Aeolus was a consistent performer at Group level when he first joined the Ed Walker stable but has slightly lost his way in the last season or two.</p><p>He can still throw in the odd big effort though and this has prevented him from dropping down the weights as he may have done otherwise.</p><p>On a going day he's a classy type and could be floating under the radar at a juicy price.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Ed Walker on Aeolus</h3></p><p>"He's in great form. We're looking forward to getting him back on the grass.</p><p>"The ground should be ideal, not sure about the track, but he's on a good mark and one he's capable of winning off. He should go well."</p><p>For the full racecard and latest odds, head to <a href=# rel>Sun Racing's new racecards.</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Royal Ascot winner Accidental Agent heads entries for Queen Elizabeth II Stakes</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cIOPbWdpbGNkv6q8zqdkoKqVlsFuv9NmrqKklqe2pXnBnqutoZ6cerG%2BxK%2Bgnq9dp8KvusSrqmaqmZmys7%2BMqJudq18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fripon-great-st-wilfrid-betting-preview-runners-riders-odds.html&text=Ripon%20Great%20St%20Wilfrid%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20riders%2c%20odds%20and%20trainer%20quotes%20for%20the%20fina&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fripon-great-st-wilfrid-betting-preview-runners-riders-odds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fripon-great-st-wilfrid-betting-preview-runners-riders-odds.html&title=Ripon%20Great%20St%20Wilfrid%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20riders%2c%20odds%20and%20trainer%20quotes%20for%20the%20fina" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fripon-great-st-wilfrid-betting-preview-runners-riders-odds.html&title=Ripon%20Great%20St%20Wilfrid%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20riders%2c%20odds%20and%20trainer%20quotes%20for%20the%20fina" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fripon-great-st-wilfrid-betting-preview-runners-riders-odds.html&title=Ripon%20Great%20St%20Wilfrid%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20riders%2c%20odds%20and%20trainer%20quotes%20for%20the%20fina" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fripon-great-st-wilfrid-betting-preview-runners-riders-odds.html&description=Ripon%20Great%20St%20Wilfrid%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20riders%2c%20odds%20and%20trainer%20quotes%20for%20the%20fina" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robin-zander.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robin Zander">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./levi-caverley-died-due-to-sand-collapse-near-new-jersey-shore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Levi Caverley Died Due To Sand Collapse Near New Jersey Shore">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
