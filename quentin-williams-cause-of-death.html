His mother is an integral part of their community, something she probably learned from her father who was a <a href=#>Baptist</a> Deacon that Queen said was a "wise man." And while Quentin didn't have the same calling as his grandfather, he was certainly inspired to serve in his own way. "He learned the political way,” said his mother. “He grew up to be an honest man and he cares about the people.”</p><p>That compassion will be Quentin's legacy, and one that others won't soon forget.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpsKmutOipWavmaG5qq3MrGScmaWosm67xWabnpmknQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fquentin-williams-cause-of-death.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Quentin%20Williams%27%20Cause%20of%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fquentin-williams-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fquentin-williams-cause-of-death.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Quentin%20Williams%27%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fquentin-williams-cause-of-death.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Quentin%20Williams%27%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fquentin-williams-cause-of-death.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Quentin%20Williams%27%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fquentin-williams-cause-of-death.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20We%20Know%20About%20Quentin%20Williams%27%20Cause%20of%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-hart-shares-rambling-statement-after-drunken-super-bowl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Hart Shares Rambling Statement After Drunken Super Bowl">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./amouranth-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amouranths Net Worth Breakdown  From Twitch to OnlyFans">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
