According to a band official, he died at his home in Destin, Florida.&nbsp;Travis Tritt, a singer-songwriter, paid homage to Cook on social media, writing:</p><p>“From @TheAlabamaBand, my heartfelt sympathies to Jeff Cook’s family, friends, and bandmates.” Such a kind gentleman and a fantastic bass fisherman. He’ll be sorely missed.”</p><p>No funeral arrangements have been made, and further information will be released shortly.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>ALABAMA has been one of my favorite bands for as long as I remember. Yesterday, founding member Jeff Cook lost his battle with Parkinson’s disease. His fiddle and guitar playing has been a huge part of my lifelong soundtrack, and my heart is heavy for the ALABAMA family!! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3qNKypaYJ7</a></p><p>— Tim McGraw (@TheTimMcGraw) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 9, 2022</a></p><h2>In 2017, Jeff Cook was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.</h2><p>Jeff Cook died on Monday as a result of Parkinson’s disease complications. In 2017, he was diagnosed with the condition, and his bandmates Randy Owen and Teddy Gentry were made aware of it.&nbsp;Cook ceased traveling in April 2017 as the sickness started to impair his health. He told his followers in a statement that the condition affected his coordination and balance and produced tremors.</p><p>According to the statement:</p><p>“This has made trying to play guitar, violin, or sing exceedingly frustrating for me.” I’ve tried not to burden people with the intricacies of my health because I don’t want the music or the party to stop, and that isn’t going to change no matter what.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jeff-Cook-1.jpg alt="Jeff Cook" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on:</p><p>“I’m not quitting, but sometimes our bodies tell us what we need to do, and mine is telling me it’s time to rest and recuperate.”</p><p>Randy Owen leaned across the table and grabbed the water bottle Cook was having difficulties opening, snapped the top off, and returned it back to him when he completed reading the statement to USA Today journalists. Owen added that it stings because people believe Cook is inebriated when he is not.&nbsp;Cook recognized something was amiss when he couldn’t throw his fishing bait precisely. This was followed by some difficulties playing certain notes on the guitar. Randy and Teddy were worried Cook had had a stroke, and Cook’s doctor said he could have Parkinson’s disease. He was subsequently tested, and the findings verified his suspicions.</p><h2>Jeff Cook was the Alabama band’s guitarist.</h2><p>Jeff Cook, who was born on August 27, 1949, attended Fort Payne High School and Jacksonville State University. Soon after, he obtained a broadcast engineering license and began working as a disc jockey at a local radio station. In 1972, he co-founded the band Wildcountry with Randy Owen and Teddy Gentry. He sang with the band and performed a variety of instruments. Cook created ensembles such as Cook & Glenn and the Allstar Goodtime Band after the band disbanded in 2004.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jeff-Cook-2.jpg alt="Jeff Cook" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jeff also founded Cook Sound Studios, Inc. and WQRX-AM radio station. He also managed a restaurant and sold his sauce.&nbsp;In addition, he supported former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee’s presidential campaign in 2008 and was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019. Jeff joined the Alabama band in 1969, and the group became well-known for tracks like Love in the First Degree, Mountain Music, Song of the South, and others. Cook’s wife Lisa, mother Betty, and brother David survive him. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that fans donate to the Jeff and Lisa Cook Foundation.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnp6WYrCwu8pmp5qro5qxbq3WmrBmmaRiwamxjJqenmWfm3p4f44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeff-cook-passed-away-at-the-age-of-73.html&text=Jeff%20Cook%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2073&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeff-cook-passed-away-at-the-age-of-73.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-cook-passed-away-at-the-age-of-73.html&title=Jeff%20Cook%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2073" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeff-cook-passed-away-at-the-age-of-73.html&title=Jeff%20Cook%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2073" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-cook-passed-away-at-the-age-of-73.html&title=Jeff%20Cook%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2073" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeff-cook-passed-away-at-the-age-of-73.html&description=Jeff%20Cook%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2073" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kennadee-nelson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kennadee Nelson">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dr-holly-phillips-gives-tips-for-a-healthier-lifestyle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dr. Holly Phillips Gives Tips for a Healthier Lifestyle">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
