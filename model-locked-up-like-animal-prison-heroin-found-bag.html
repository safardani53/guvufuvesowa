How terrible we were.</p><p>"No family, locked up like animals, humiliation. And I try to shake such thoughts out of my head right away, but sometimes it doesn't go away right away."</p><p>The blonde dropped out of <a href=#>school</a> in her hometown of Uherské Hradiště in the <a href=#>Czech Republic</a> and began working in a cafe - where she was offered a job as a sex worker.</p><p>As the "conditions seemed favourable", she agreed and was flown to <a href=#>Belgium</a> where she was taken "under the wing of a woman called Sara."</p><p>Tereza said: "She first wanted to check whether I was suitable for the <a href=#>job</a>.</p><p>"She told me to go and have sex with her husband to check if I'm worth it or not. And so I did what I had to do."</p><p>To "cope" with her clients and "release her inhibitions and fear", the model turned to drugs and alcohol and adopted the name Jennifer.</p><p>A prostitute doesn't enjoy sex, because in order to survive, she has to switch to robot mode and work.</p><span class=quote-credit>Tereza Hluskova</span><p>She alleged she was plied with substances by Sara, allowing her to "learn to shut down emotions during intimate moments with clients."</p><p>Tereza continued: "I felt almost nothing at all. Maybe the problem was that I drank a lot.</p><p>"I had plum juice in one hand, vodka in the other, and in two hours I was lying there and they had to resuscitate me.</p><p>"A prostitute doesn't enjoy sex, because in order to survive, she has to switch to robot mode and work."</p><p>She shared the gory details of a few "brutal" encounters, but admitted her memory was hazy because she was "off her head" on drugs and booze.</p><p>Tereza said she was then taken to a Belgian bar where escorts went to meet their clients, while donning a black mini dress and high heels.</p><p>She recalled: "I had a meeting there with a man named Ludo, all I knew was that he had red glasses and a moustache.</p><p>"When I reached for the doorknob, I thought I was going to throw up or run away. But I said no. I was already in it so I entered."</p><p>Her work as an escort soon turned nasty, seeing her endure a savage beating from a <a href=#>Turkish</a> client who tried to suffocate her after sex.</p><p>Tereza said she took "revenge" by telling her pimp what had happened, adding: "I told the guys how he treated me, and then they gave him hell."</p><p>She was then told she was being sent to the <a href=#>UK</a> to do some erotic photo modelling and pick up a visa before flying to Pakistan.</p><p>Upon her arrival in <a href=#>Manchester</a>, she stayed with a man from Pakistan who was arranging her travel documents who informed her she would be travelling to the country via <a href=#>France</a>.</p><h2>'I DIDN'T KNOW'</h2><p>The model said: "Now I wonder how I could have been so stupid that there were such detours when it was supposed to be a direct flight from England to Pakistan. But I didn't realize it at the time."</p><p>When she finally arrived in the South Asian nation, she was sent to live in a house with no electricity alongside her "keeper" who escorted her from France.</p><p>Tereza said: "It was a disaster. Dirt everywhere on the ground, not even sidewalks, but scattered dirt."</p><p>She was taken to a "kind of field where there was only dirt" for a photoshoot and spent two months waiting for the pictures to appear online, but they never did.</p><p>Tereza was finally told she could return home and believed the ordeal was over - unaware that her nightmare was only just beginning.</p><p>Customs officials pounced her at the airport after finding nearly 9kg of heroin stashed in "statues" in her suitcase as she was trying to board a flight headed for the <a href=#>United Arab Emirates</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Video footage shows officers rummaging through her bags while the model broke down in tears.</p><p>She told cops: "They gave me something for luggage, three statues or something. They said it was gifts.</p><p>"I didn't know there was something inside."</p><p>Tereza is now working to rebuild her life, securing a job as a waitress and settling down with a new man.</p><p>She promised to continue sharing details of her horror experience in future videos while she tries to come to terms with the ordeal.</p><p>"A person who has been in prison for four years has to get used to socialising again," she added.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Pakistan shares a long porous border with <a href=#>Afghanistan</a>, providing a key drug-smuggling route to Central Asia, Europe and North America.</p><p>Drug trafficking is a serious offence in Pakistan and arrests at airports are not uncommon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tereza-hluskova-czech-beauty-tereza-453417639.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tereza-hluskova-czech-beauty-tereza-452943883.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tereza-hluskova-czech-beauty-tereza-452943896.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ355gJRqaWtnnaSxpriMpaaco5WZera8jKWgpJ1dlruqucClZKmqmai8r3nHnqmooZ5is7DBzZ1km5mXZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmodel-locked-up-like-animal-prison-heroin-found-bag.html&text=I%20was%20locked%20up%20%27like%20an%20animal%27%20in%20prison%20after%201m%20of%20heroin%20was%20found%20in%20my%20bag%20-%20I%20thought%20I%27d%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmodel-locked-up-like-animal-prison-heroin-found-bag.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmodel-locked-up-like-animal-prison-heroin-found-bag.html&title=I%20was%20locked%20up%20%27like%20an%20animal%27%20in%20prison%20after%201m%20of%20heroin%20was%20found%20in%20my%20bag%20-%20I%20thought%20I%27d%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmodel-locked-up-like-animal-prison-heroin-found-bag.html&title=I%20was%20locked%20up%20%27like%20an%20animal%27%20in%20prison%20after%201m%20of%20heroin%20was%20found%20in%20my%20bag%20-%20I%20thought%20I%27d%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmodel-locked-up-like-animal-prison-heroin-found-bag.html&title=I%20was%20locked%20up%20%27like%20an%20animal%27%20in%20prison%20after%201m%20of%20heroin%20was%20found%20in%20my%20bag%20-%20I%20thought%20I%27d%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmodel-locked-up-like-animal-prison-heroin-found-bag.html&description=I%20was%20locked%20up%20%27like%20an%20animal%27%20in%20prison%20after%201m%20of%20heroin%20was%20found%20in%20my%20bag%20-%20I%20thought%20I%27d%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-bt-sport-free-with-amazon-prime.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is BT Sport free with Amazon Prime?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ben-napier-wishes-wife-erin-happy-birthday-with-wedding-day-throwback-photo-my-favorite-magazine-cover-girl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Napier Wishes Wife Erin Happy Birthday With Wedding Day Photo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
