We were convinced that [each other] or people around us were selling stories and making money on things that were very contentious for us.</p><p>"'You sold a story', 'no I haven’t you must have done it', 'I haven’t done it must be your mate', 'they haven’t done it must be your mate', and trust disintegrated to nothing."</p><p>Jeff also suggests their phones were being tapped: "Looking back now it was entirely obvious we were being hacked."</p><p>"It made a difficult <a href=#>relationship</a> impossible," he added.</p><h2>What happened to Jeff and Jade's kids?</h2><p><a href=#>Jeff gained full custody of their two sons,</a> after Jade tragically died on March 22, 2009.</p><p>Jeff spoke about the loss of the mother of his children, Jade, <a href=#>in a life insurance advert</a>, saying: "I think most people know that for the last 10 years, I've been bringing up my children Bobby and Freddie after they lost their mum, Jade, to<a href=#> cervical cancer.</a></p><p>"It's insanely unfair that they were robbed of someone that was such an incredible mum. I remember when Jade very bravely told them that she was going to be in heaven.</p><p>"For six months after that they were absolutely all over the place. From the moment your children are born and you hold them in your arms and you realise how small and fragile they are, I think you immediately become their protector.</p><p>"I very quickly realised that I was going to be responsible for the boys, for the rest of their childhood."</p><p>Jeff says he still takes his sons every year at <a href=#>Christmas</a> to <a href=#>visit their mum's grave.</a></p><h2>When did Jeff Brazier marry Kate Dwyer?</h2><p>Jeff began dating <a href=#>Kate Dwyer</a> in 2013 and the pair were together for four years before<a href=#> they got engaged in Ibiza in 2017.&nbsp;</a></p><p>In September 2018 <a href=#>Jeff married Kate Dwyer</a> in a spectacular cliff-top ceremony in Portugal.</p><p>Jade and Jeff's children, Bobby and Freddie were best men for their father on his wedding day.</p><p>Jeff said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello!</a> magazine: "This isn't just any wedding, this is a really special one.</p><p>“It doesn't just represent Kate and I putting rings on each other's fingers. It represents the fact that we won at something really tricky. We won at becoming a family.</p><p>“Before it was just three boys rattling around in a house on our own, trying to get through life. Then Kate came along and worked so hard at making us complete."</p><p>It was reported that the pair were experiencing <a href=#>trouble in their marriage in 2019</a>, and announced a split in 2022, before <a href=#>getting back together in 2023.&nbsp;</a></p><h2>What does Jeff Brazier do now?</h2><p>Since Jade's death, Jeff has regularly campaigned to raise awareness about cervical and testicular cancer.</p><p>He also fights for more young people<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;to have the HPV jab</a>, which would have <a href=#>stopped Jade getting the HPV infection</a> that ultimately led to her cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Jeff writes and lectures about coming to terms with grief, alongside television presenting work.</p><p>He published a book called The Grief Survival Guide in 2017.</p><p>Jeff has also campaigned to encourage people to go to the doctor regularly, attend cervical smear tests, and conquer the Fear Of Finding Out (FOFO) that you may have cancer.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=#>The Sun Online</a>, he said: "Jade had warnings, she had letters from the doctors and in her mind, she hoped that if she just ignored it, it would go away.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON JEFF BRAZIER</h2></p><h2>What's Jeff's background and how did he become famous?</h2><p><a href=#>Jeff Brazier</a>, 44, was born on May 27, 1979.</p><p>Jeff's father, Stephen Faldo, worked and died on a pleasure boat called Marchioness which sank on the River Thames in 1989.</p><p><a href=#>Jeff had a career</a> as a professional footballer for teams such as Leyton Orient between 1996-2001.</p><p>He found relative fame in 2001 when he participated in Channel 4's reality show, Shipwrecked.</p><p>Then in 2003, Jeff and then partner Jade appeared in Celebrity Wife Swap.</p><p>After a panto stint in Aladdin in 2005, Jeff has took part in other reality TV shows, such as The Farm and I'm Famous And Frightened! before shifting to presenting.</p><p>Jeff joined I'm A Celebrity...
