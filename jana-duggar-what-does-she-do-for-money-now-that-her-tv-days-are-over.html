I am grateful for law enforcement and those who protect and serve our community,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.</p><p>“In the end, I was just upset at myself that it had happened at all but so thankful it all ended safely and that’s truly what mattered the most to me.”</p><p><a href=#>Jana pled guilty to child endangerment</a>, but everyone involved seemed to agree that it was an honest mistake, and her parents continue to entrust her with the care of their youngest children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So Jana’s days are rather full — especially since she uses what little free time she has to pursue her business interests.</p><p>Jana has not updated her Instagram page in almost a year, but until recently, her bio listed her profession as “home remodeler.”</p><p>It’s unclear what sort of projects Jana has worked on, but it seems that she’s been reasonably well-compensated for her efforts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to a <a href=#>recent report</a> from In Touch, Jana’s net worth is in the $400,000 range.</p><p>The last time the Duggars directly commented on Jana’s career ambitions was in 2015, when she and twin brother John David turned 25.</p><p>“John just finished up his pilot’s license and is staying busy with construction and police work,” the family wrote at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Jana is a concert pianist and is involved in many ministries. We are so blessed to have such wonderful daughters and sons! Happy 25th, Jana and John!”</p><p>Fans were quick to push back, noting that Jana has likely received very little in the way of formal training, and that playing piano at church does not make one a “concert pianist.”</p><p>“As a trained musician myself I would like to know where Jana has studied music, and what degrees (if any) she holds,” one commenter wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I’m sure that she is a fine pianist, but playing at the local church … does not make one a concert pianist. Duggars… let’s be honest and not try to make the kids into things they are not.”</p><p>“Concert pianist?” wrote another. “Let them go be free. 25 is no age to share a room with toddlers. Stop stunting their lives.”</p><p>So yeah, even before the most recent Duggar scandals, Jana had ample reason to keep a low profile with regard to her career goals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>No doubt she’s been severely limited by her parents’ backward belief system, but fans continue to hope that Jana has been able to enjoy a modicum of independence in her adulthood.</p><p>It would be wonderful to see her leave the nest and really set out on her own, but it seems increasingly unlikely that that will ever happen!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2FcLbAp5hmnKWctKK%2BjLCfmqxdmbymv4ysn55llKR6p7vRZqSoppWueq%2B71maroZmkYrWmvoytrWacka7Abq3RnmSorpWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjana-duggar-what-does-she-do-for-money-now-that-her-tv-days-are-over.html&text=What%20Does%20She%20Do%20For%20Money%2c%20Now%20That%20Her%20TV%20Days%20Are%20Over%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjana-duggar-what-does-she-do-for-money-now-that-her-tv-days-are-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjana-duggar-what-does-she-do-for-money-now-that-her-tv-days-are-over.html&title=What%20Does%20She%20Do%20For%20Money%2c%20Now%20That%20Her%20TV%20Days%20Are%20Over%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjana-duggar-what-does-she-do-for-money-now-that-her-tv-days-are-over.html&title=What%20Does%20She%20Do%20For%20Money%2c%20Now%20That%20Her%20TV%20Days%20Are%20Over%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjana-duggar-what-does-she-do-for-money-now-that-her-tv-days-are-over.html&title=What%20Does%20She%20Do%20For%20Money%2c%20Now%20That%20Her%20TV%20Days%20Are%20Over%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjana-duggar-what-does-she-do-for-money-now-that-her-tv-days-are-over.html&description=What%20Does%20She%20Do%20For%20Money%2c%20Now%20That%20Her%20TV%20Days%20Are%20Over%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chase-matthew-dcqg-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chase Matthew (Country Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp;
