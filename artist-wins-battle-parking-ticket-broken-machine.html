But I don't like to be taken advantage of.</p><p>"But I kept reminding myself justice has to be done.</p><p>"I had friends who said to just pay the fine but I wasn't going to be bullied.</p><p>"No one likes getting a parking ticket but this wasn't even justified in the slightest.</p><h2>JUSTICE</h2><p>"I followed what was instructed by the company and that was to phone them and tell them the machine was broken.</p><p>"A lot of people would have just paid to get them off their backs.</p><p>"But I wanted to stand my ground.</p><p>"I was speaking to staff at the restaurant and they had said this had happened to customers before.</p><p>"The machine was broken and there was not an alternative way to pay the charges yet I was being told I had to pay a parking fine.</p><p>"It's just not on. I made every effort to pay on the day.</p><p>"Excel said I ought to have paid using another machine. There wasn't another one in the car park!</p><p>"It's just money grabbing and they are able to exploit people with the threat of debt collectors and court."</p><h2>'TEACH THE BULLIES A LESSON'</h2><p>After being issued a second letter in the post to say the fine had increased from £100 to £250, stubborn Linda stood her ground to "teach the bullies a lesson".</p><p>She bought a lever arch file and began photocopying and printing out letters of correspondence between Excel and herself -- in preparation for an eventual court case.</p><p>Linda, married to Jonathan, 56, said: "My husband is a lawyer but this isn't his field of expertise.</p><p>"I did all the work myself. I bought a big folder and kept all the documents and correspondence in there.</p><p>"Our defence didn't change from the first letter we wrote in May 2016 to going to court.</p><p>"I had to prepare a skeleton argument for the defence. I didn't want to hire anyone as it would have raked up a silly amount.</p><p>"I wrote every letter, sent the copies off to court, instructed their legal team.</p><p>On August 4 2021 Linda won her case at Manchester County Court which saw her £250 penalty fare written off.</p><p>Linda said: "I'm just absolutely thrilled I won!</p><p>"It was a long time and I went through three bereavements during that time - including my mum which was really hard.</p><p>"The pandemic has been hard for everyone too.</p><p>"This happened before we left the European Union which just goes to show how the ridiculous time it has gone on for.</p><p>"I hope from this others will have the courage to stand up to these companies."</p><h2>'UNUSUAL CASE'</h2><p>A spokesman for Excel Parking Services Ltd said: "This was an unusual case in that there had been a clear breach of the terms and conditions of parking as no pay and display ticket had been purchased for the period of parking.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"However, in light of the circumstances of the case, the judge decided that the call made by Ms Edwards to our Helpline represented, on this occasion, an intention to pay once the machine had been repaired.</p><p>"Our call handler should have either given Ms Edwards' a formal exemption from paying for parking or, advised her to find an alternative parking location."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000679528007.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000679527942.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bonkers driver caught using STRING to move his windscreen wipers as he speeds down motorway in pouring rain</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoNyfpRrb25nkafBqr%2FTZq6ipqNir6LA06WcZqiRp7iqusZmq6Kbm5rBbq7RqKKepl2irqS0yKecaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fartist-wins-battle-parking-ticket-broken-machine.html&text=Artist%2c%2058%2c%20wins%20five%20year%20battle%20over%201%20parking%20ticket%20after%20being%20unable%20to%20pay%20at%20broken%20machin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fartist-wins-battle-parking-ticket-broken-machine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fartist-wins-battle-parking-ticket-broken-machine.html&title=Artist%2c%2058%2c%20wins%20five%20year%20battle%20over%201%20parking%20ticket%20after%20being%20unable%20to%20pay%20at%20broken%20machin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fartist-wins-battle-parking-ticket-broken-machine.html&title=Artist%2c%2058%2c%20wins%20five%20year%20battle%20over%201%20parking%20ticket%20after%20being%20unable%20to%20pay%20at%20broken%20machin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fartist-wins-battle-parking-ticket-broken-machine.html&title=Artist%2c%2058%2c%20wins%20five%20year%20battle%20over%201%20parking%20ticket%20after%20being%20unable%20to%20pay%20at%20broken%20machin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fartist-wins-battle-parking-ticket-broken-machine.html&description=Artist%2c%2058%2c%20wins%20five%20year%20battle%20over%201%20parking%20ticket%20after%20being%20unable%20to%20pay%20at%20broken%20machin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ben-simmons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Simmons">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nej.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Nej>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
