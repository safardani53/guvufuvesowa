So you can imagine their shock when <a href=#>Matt Roloff</a> listed a portion of the farm for sale in 2022. But how much, exactly, did the farm sell for? Keep reading for the latest updates.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much did Matt Roloff sell the farm for?</h2><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes Global Properties</a> listed the farmhouse (and surrounding acreage) on Roloff Farms for $4 million, as of Oct. 31, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor.com</a> says it's currently "off market." The property, which is located at 23985 NW Grossen Drive, Hillsboro, Ore., has since been pulled from the open market.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Zillow</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matt Roloff announced the farmhouse will be used as a short-term rental.</h2><p>On. Oct. 21, Matt took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram </a>to offer an update on the sale of the farmhouse. "When I put the small side of the farm up for sale I knew large deals like that take a much longer time (i.e. 6-12 months) to complete with no guarantees," he wrote. "What I didn’t expect was how many new business partners and networking connections I would make in the process."</p><p>Matt went on to explain that companies had approached him about using the "big house" and surrounding acreage as a short-term rental ("think AirBnB"). Ultimately, he decided to partner with iTrip Vacations.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Matt Roloff (@mattroloff)</a></p></figure><p>He added: "Fees will be determined by demand and seasons. More information will be forthcoming soon … but needless to say we are scrambling hard behind the scenes (plus running the busy pumpkin patch) to convert (re-furnish) the home to be ready for its first guests. At this point … we are not live yet but working [feverously] to get it ready before year end."</p><p>Matt also mentioned it would be ideal for family reunions.</p><p>Fast-forward to December 2022, and it looks like you can already start booking a night at the Hillsboro, Ore., farmhouse at Roloff Farms on <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">iTrip.net</a>. It'll cost you a pretty penny — between $566.71 and $2,020 per night, as of writing, to be exact. The catch is you have to book a minimum of three nights.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iTrips.net</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's a look at what you can expect if you decide to do a short-term rental at Roloff Farms.</h2><p>The short-term rental features six bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, and sleeps up to 16 people. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iTrip</a>, it also features the following amenities:</p><ul><li style=text-align:start>in-ground hot tub and pool</li><li style=text-align:start>covered patio area with fire table</li><li style=text-align:start>new decor and furnishings</li></ul><ul><li style=text-align:start>garage turned game room with ping pong, foosball, cornhole, and TV</li><li style=text-align:start>fully stocked kitchen and pantry</li><li style=text-align:start>two offices</li><li style=text-align:start>billiard room with game tables, TV, and seating</li><li style=text-align:start>gated and private entrance</li><li style=text-align:start>multiple areas for outdoor seating.</li></ul><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Zillow</span></figure><p>A "full-scale pirate's ship" was also listed — however, as Matt revealed via Facebook, he opted to move the ship off the property and keep it in a different area of the farm he owns.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Matt Roloff (@mattroloff)</a></p></figure><p style=text-align:start>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little People, Big World Season 24 trailer</a>, Caryn mentioned a "big plan B," in relation to the future of the farm — and now we finally know what that was.

"I am ready to go in a completely new direction."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TLC (@tlc)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much did Zach offer Matt for the farm?</h2><p>Specific numbers have not been discussed in Little People, Big World. However, both father and son have indicated that their price points were not even close when it came to negotiating a deal on the farm. Zach even suggested that Matt's price was actually more than double what he offered.</p><p>"The price that my dad's quoting is more than I can afford," Zach explained during the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 23 premiere of LPBW</a>. "I had a starting point, and it was based on what my dad bought my mom out for. This amount was very, very high. I can understand there's some appreciation. But he went beyond, I think, the normal appreciation. I said no to my dad, and he's not used to people telling him no."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In Season 23, Episode 8, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt offered even more insight</a> into the failed negotiations with his sons.</p><p>"<a href=#>Jeremy</a> made an offer on the farm and didn't quite work out, and then Zach came in with an offer on the farm. It was, it didn't quite work out," he said. "I don't think either one of them are really interested in running a pumpkin patch, you know."</p><p>Matt continued: "People might think that I'm just making a cold-hearted business decision, but this is not easy for me. I've spent years agonizing about what to do with this side of the farm and I think it's finally time to let it go. I have wonderful memories of raising the family in that house. But I learned a long time ago that you can't get stuck in the past, you have to keep moving forward in life."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TLC (@tlc)</a></p></figure><p>Still, Matt acknowledged that his kids likely wouldn't take the news of his listing the farm house well. He said he hoped it wouldn't cause an even worse familial rift. "I think Zach might be really shocked when he hears what my listing price is going to be compared to the price that he was offered," Matt explained. "I think Zach missed out on a very, very good deal."</p><p>Spoiler alert: Zach, Tori, and the rest of the family weren't necessarily shocked by the news — but they were pretty pissed.</p><p>Now that Matt has decided to turn the big house into a short-term rental property, it'll be interesting to see if selling it to one of his kids will be back on the table in the future. Fans will have to tune in to learn what ultimately becomes of Roloff Farms.</p><p>Catch new episodes oof Little People, Big World 9 p.m. EST on TLC and on Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllJ6xbrnAratmqp%2BhvKeyjKycpaRdqbWmecWaqaZllqS%2F</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-did-matt-roloff-sell-the-farm-for.html&text=%27LPBW%27%20Fans%20Can%20Now%20Book%20the%20Farmhouse%20as%20a%20Short-Term%20Rental&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-did-matt-roloff-sell-the-farm-for.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-matt-roloff-sell-the-farm-for.html&title=%27LPBW%27%20Fans%20Can%20Now%20Book%20the%20Farmhouse%20as%20a%20Short-Term%20Rental" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-did-matt-roloff-sell-the-farm-for.html&title=%27LPBW%27%20Fans%20Can%20Now%20Book%20the%20Farmhouse%20as%20a%20Short-Term%20Rental" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-matt-roloff-sell-the-farm-for.html&title=%27LPBW%27%20Fans%20Can%20Now%20Book%20the%20Farmhouse%20as%20a%20Short-Term%20Rental" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-did-matt-roloff-sell-the-farm-for.html&description=%27LPBW%27%20Fans%20Can%20Now%20Book%20the%20Farmhouse%20as%20a%20Short-Term%20Rental" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cynthia-bailey-opens-up-about-the-final-straw-that-led-to-her-split-from-mike-hill.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cynthia Bailey Reveals 'Final Straw' That Led to Split from Mike Hill">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./james-kennedy-raquel-leviss-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Pics Of The Loving Couple  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
