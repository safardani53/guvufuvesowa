He is the eldest child of Mattie Claybrook Paden.</p><p>However, the player says that his father left their family just after he was born and went to work for the Marines.</p><p>Caron grew up in Racine, Wisconsin, and had a tough childhood. His mother raised him and his half-brother, Melvin III as a single mother. She worked two different jobs to feed her children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Caron-Butler-in-his-childhood.jpg><p>Even though they were in a miserable situation, his mother admitted him to Washington Park High School.</p><p>However, he could not focus on his studies as the financial difficulty of his home had a deep impression on him.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, he started engaging in illegal activities at a very young age. He had already become an infamous drug dealer at age 15.</p><p>Butler was arrested from his high school for possessing a gun and a packet of cocaine at age 14.</p><p>He did not go to school for many years and spent much time in juvenile detention centers. In one of these detention centers, he became aware of his basketball abilities.</p><p>Hence, Caron began playing the sport with other boys there and showed his caliber.</p><p>As he spent time away from his mother, he began to feel sorry for her. After getting released from the juvenile center, he joined the Park School again.</p><p>He began playing inter-school tournaments and showed much promise. Eventually, Butler left his old ways and came to his senses. As a result, he did good both in studies as well as sports.</p><p>After high school, he joined the University of Connecticut and, much later, Duke University for his further studies.&nbsp;</p><h2>Age, Weight & Height</h2><p>As of <span>2023, the former NBA champion is 43 years old. He celebrates his birthday every March 13.</span></p><p>Talking about his body measurements, he stands 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighs around 228 lb (103 kg).</p><p>In addition, he has black-colored hair and dark brown eyes.</p><h2>Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Even though Caron Butler did not have enough time to focus on basketball in his school days, he played high school basketball for Racine Park.</p><p>While there, he began working on basic skills and improved in a short time.</p><p>As a result, he played in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for about two years in the late 90s. He mostly preferred playing in the small forward position.</p><p>However, sometimes, the coaches assign him the position of shooting guard.</p><p>Later on, he joined the Maine Central Institute for a brief period. Soon after, Butler received a scholarship from the University of Connecticut to play for the UConn Huskies.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Caron Butler joined the University of Connecticut in 2000 to play collegiate basketball. Even though he had gained quite some weight initially, he soon lost around 15 pounds and regained his pace.</p><p>He played excellently in the 2000 NCAA tournament and averaged 15.3 points and 7.6 rebounds per game as a freshman. He became one of the top point scorers for the Huskies’ first season.</p><p>Moving on to the second season, Butler picked up even better form and obtained incredible stats. Again, he shocked everyone averaging 20.3 and 7.5 rebounds per game.</p><p>Consequently, he led his team to win regular-season titles in 2001. In addition, he performed exceptionally well during the Big East Conference and earned numerous honors.</p><p>Eventually, he decided it was high time to declare for the upcoming NBA draft. So he left his college career two years ahead and went for the draft in 2002.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>The Miami Heat selected him as the 2002 NBA draft’s first-round 10th pick. The team trusted him even as a rookie, and he played all seasonal matches and started all of them.</p><p>Butler played excellently and finished his first NBA season, averaging 15.4 points and 5.1 rebounds per game. As a result, the young player received numerous accolades in his debut season.</p><p>Nevertheless, his second NBA season did not go well. He frequently suffered from injuries and missed many matches.</p><p>Hence, his stats drastically lowered, and eventually, the Heats traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2004-5 season, where he was able to play with NBA legend <a href=# rel=noopener>Kobe Bryant</a> and develop a brotherhood.&nbsp;</p><p>After playing for the whole season, the LA Lakers transferred him to the Washington Wizards.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Caron-Butler-in-the-Washington-Wizards-jersey.jpg><p>Butler played for about five NBA seasons for the Wizards. Being at the prime of the game of his career, he recorded over 15.0 points per game in all the seasons.</p><p>During his time with the Wizards, he faced a hand injury and missed many matches in the 2007-08 season.</p><p>Eventually, they traded him to the Dallas Mavericks on February 13, 2010. Caron played only one season with the Mavericks, finally winning a championship ring with them.</p><p>During his second season with the Mavericks, he suffered a tendon injury and underwent surgery before returning to the court.</p><p>After the surgery, he played six more NBA seasons but could not make significant records.</p><p>Finally, he announced his retirement from his professional career on February 6, 2018.</p><h3>Post-NBA Career</h3><p>After retiring from professional basketball, he joined ESPN as an NBA analyst and overlooked college basketball. Moving on, he also worked at FS1 as an analyst.</p><p>In addition, he is the author of two books. However, he wrote his first book, “Tuff Juice: My Journey from the Streets to the NBA,” an autobiography, while he was still actively playing in the league.</p><p>Moreover, he has co-written a book named “Shot Clock” with Justin A. Reynolds, which was released in September 2022.</p><p>He finally began working as an assistant coach for the Miami Heat on November 14, 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Some of his awards and achievements include:</p><ul><li>NBA Champion (2011)</li><li>NBA All-Rookie First Team (2003)</li><li>Big East Player of The Year (2002)</li><li>NBA All-Star (2007, 2008)</li><li>Third-team All-Big East (2001)</li><li>First-team All-Big East (2002)</li></ul><h2>Wife & Kids</h2><p>Caron Butler is currently married to his long-time girlfriend, Andrea Pink.
