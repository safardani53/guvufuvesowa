(Published on 22 April 2018)</p><p dir=ltr>Daymond is also the founder of the brand management and consulting firm, The Shark Group, which is located in Manhattan, New York. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>Daymond John’s Bio: Family, Age, Height and Career</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>Born on 23 February 1969, Daymond Garfield John was raised in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis along with his seven siblings. He participated in a program in high school that allowed him to work a full-time job. After graduating high school, Daymond didn’t attend college and started a commuter van service to support his family financially.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Tara Palmeri, 30-Age: From Birthday To Obscure Married Life Status And More" rel=follow>Tara Palmeri, 30-Age: From Birthday To Obscure Married Life Status And More</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>The 49-year-old entrepreneur started FUBU (For Us By Us) in his mother’s house after learning to sew from his mother. FUBU’s wool ski hats with tops became an instant hit that sold for $10 each. Bringing some friends into the business, Daymond started sewing the FUBU logo on jerseys, sweatshirts, and t-shirts.</p><p dir=ltr>Eventually, they became known as a prominent apparel brand despite having a small company. Many stores started to request their brand, and in 1994, Daymond received an offer to participate at the Las Vegas fashion show, MAGIC. From then on the brand really took off and Daymond and family have never looked back ever since. The brand now boasts sales of over&nbsp;$6 billion worldwide. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>Standing at the height of 5 feet and 7 inches, Daymond also provides&nbsp;motivational speeches about his rags to riches tale and inspires millions hoping to become an entrepreneur. Not just that, the prominent black entrepreneur has been felicitated with numerous awards like Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneur of the Year and more.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h3 dir=ltr><strong>Daymon John Looked Back At His Career: Lost Many Friends</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>In November 2018, Daymond looked back at his past and talked about how he turned his finance upside down with the help of his entrepreneur skills on CNBC's The Brave Ones.</p><p dir=ltr>There were times when he had nothing to hold on to, as he grew up in the Hollis, Queens neighborhood of New York City during the time it was hit with the crack epidemic of the 1980s and his friends would aspire to be drug dealers.</p><p dir=ltr>And many of my friends were dead or in jail at the age of 16 to 17. I was losing a friend every three months. (-said by Daymond John on CNBN | 16 November 2018)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p dir=ltr>But then something became more popular - making music. The music artists were as wealthy or more wealthy than crack dealers while selling music. While hip-hop was the social currency of the time and voice of the streets, Daymond took the brands that existed in those days and gave it his own spin.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Read Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jennifer Ashton Divorced With Husband!

It wasn’t always like this for Daymond when it came to riches though. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>Growing up in a middle-class family, Daymond started working from an early age selling stationery in school and raking leaves in the fall.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p dir=ltr>Following on the goal of becoming an entrepreneur, he made a massive fortune after launching the highly successful clothing line, FUBU that generated more than $350 million a year within six years.</p><p dir=ltr>As the brand’s popularity started to fade, Daymond didn’t sit idly, appearing on the reality show, Shark Tanks, where he has invested more than $7.5 Million which has ably supplemented his net worth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3 dir=ltr><strong>Daymond’s Successful Recovery from Cancer</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>Having had numerous battles since his early age, middle age was no different for the Hollis native as he faced the most serious battle he has ever had in 2017, Cancer.</p><p dir=ltr>It was in May 2017 that Daymond revealed his cancer battle to the public. Daymond was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in March 2017 when he was undergoing an executive physical. Daymond’s doctor found a nodule on his thyroid and after the surgery in April, it was revealed that there was an unusual mass of cells and that it was 'Stage 2' cancer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p dir=ltr>While talking about his cancer to PEOPLE, Daymond said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p dir=ltr>I’m so grateful that I went and got this thing looked into. I know there are a lot of debates about if executive physicals are worth it or not, but in my case it was worth more than gold-or anything else-because it saved me from a lot of potential problems down the road.</p><p dir=ltr>As of now, Daymond is cancer-free and will have to get his thyroid checked regularly for the rest of his life. He further mentioned that he was relieved for not having to go through any pain or suffering and suggests that people have their health in check.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="What Is David Rubulotta Net Worth?
