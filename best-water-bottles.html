But how often do you actually reach that goal, and how much has to do with not having a reusable water bottle to tote around? Having a stylish bottle that keeps your beverage cold may just help increase that water intake, whether you're at home or on the go. With the plentiful options out there, from Yetis to Britas, you'll never know until you try.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may have seen the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>motivational gallon jug</a> that had celebrities like Khloé Kardashian quickly adding to their carts, but there are real perks to using refillable water bottles like these to keep you hydrated throughout your day and be more eco-conscious. While Dana Cohen, M.D. and medical advisor for Cure, suggests adding more fruit and veggies to your diet to increase your hydration, she has a few hard rules when it comes to water intake as well. "Front load your water by drinking 8 to 16 ounces first thing in the morning," Cohen advises before diving into her tips. "I also drink a glass of water before every meal [and] keep a big bottle of water on my desk that I refill, and it's in front of me all the time," she shares. (Hint: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Soda water makers</a> can help up your consumption level, too).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help narrow your search, we tested 26 water bottles with varying features and designs to see which one you need to achieve maximum hydration.

Though this specific size can hold up to 24 ounces of water, there are sizes ranging from 18 to 64 ounces depending on the type of water drinker you are (and how heavy of a bottle you're okay with carrying around). Made with double-wall vacuum insulation, this bottle was able to keep the water we tested with colder than what it was when it was first filled up (thanks to the ice that was added) even after six hours. This was one of the top performers in our insulation test, keeping the temperature five degrees colder at six hours than when it was filled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Takeya also did extremely well during the drop test, where it was dropped on the floor three times from table height. We dropped it on the cap, and every time it remained intact with no leaks or cracks. We were pleasantly surprised by how durable this bottle is. Though there was slight leakage when turned on its side and jostled around inside a backpack, this bottle performed very well compared to the others and proved to be one of the most leak-free options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We think Takeya is ideal for an active person but perfect for really anyone. It's a great water bottle for everyday use because of the smaller cap and ease of drinking from that while being in motion, along with its durability. At its reasonable price compared to others on the market, sleek design, and standout performance, it's easy to see why this bottle swept the competition.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> 18/8 food grade stainless steel | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 24 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.25 x 3.25 x 10.38 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1 pound | <strong>Insulated: </strong>Yes, double wall | <strong>Lid Type:</strong> Twist-off cap with spout | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes | <strong>BPA-Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nalgene-32oz-wide-mouth-ultralite-bottle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nalgene 32oz Wide Mouth Ultralite Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1197 data-sizes=750px alt="Nalgene 32oz Wide Mouth Ultralite Bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qfTX1hwGagY65nCQDOhlFwIscZU=/fit-in/1500x1197/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/51UJoaYE0iL._AC_SL1200_-2b6c78bbec1f4cb0a8f67c57c4bffc3d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>This bottle can hold up to 32 ounces of water, so you don't have to refill it frequently.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The attached loop makes it easy to carry.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's made of durable plastic that withstood our drop test.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone loves a good way to save, and you'll be saving on not just the cost of water bottle packs but traditional prices of reusable bottles as well thanks to the Nalgene Wide Mouth Ultralite Bottle. This plastic bottle weighs next to nothing and can hold up to 32 ounces, which requires fewer refills throughout the day to achieve optimal water intake. The handy loop that connects the twist-off cap to the bottle also provides an extra feature for functionality. The loop makes it easy to hold or connect to a carabiner to attach it to a pack, bike, or what have you. Since it's durable enough for the outdoors, we found that this bottle was made of strong enough plastic to where the drop test had seemingly no effect on the bottle at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But besides holding it, connecting it to a bike, or storing it in your bag, it's a bit hard to bring around due to its size. The wide bottle doesn't fit in a standard cup holder, and it wouldn't be good for kids or folks with small hands. It did, however, fit snugly in a backpack pocket. This may just be the bottle for you if you plan to hook it onto a bag or piece of equipment or if you simply want to save a little cash while upping your water intake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Plastic | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 32 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.5 x 3.5 x 8 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.75 ounces | <strong>Insulated: </strong>No | <strong>Lid Type:</strong> Twist-off cap | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes | <strong>BPA-Free: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-yeti-rambler-26-oz-bottle-with-chug-cap></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Splurge</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>YETI Rambler 26 oz Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="YETI Rambler 26 oz Bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hQr0Xuzxo8RdTBLd7XGqQuijjJA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/YETI-Rambler-26-oz-Bottle-27cc82d80ec2414d8f9af609c07727a5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>YETI</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The mouth opening is conveniently designed so it's easy to drink from.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The double-wall insulation keeps the water super cold.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It comes in a wide assortment of colors.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We all know Yeti to be a great drinkware brand, and the Rambler Bottle is no exception to this reputation. Not only is it made from durable stainless steel that passed our drop test wonderfully, but it comes in an array of colorful hues to match your style. We found it to be a delight to drink from and noted that the chug cap was very well-designed for water flow, and the double-wall vacuum insulation kept the water freezing cold. But this specific style can do it all, as the insulated interior performs well with both cold and hot drinks. There were no spills to be had during the testing process, and the paint was still intact after being dropped three times, thanks to the durable sealant used on this bottle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Yeti Rambler was a bit wider than a typical water bottle, which made it a little challenging to carry normally or put in the cup holder comfortably (it's a bit snug). However, there's a convenient top handle that you can use to carry around the bottle or attach to your backpack with a carabiner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> 18/8 stainless steel | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 26 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.5 x 3.5 x 11 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 22.22 ounces | <strong>Insulated: </strong>Yes, double wall | <strong>Lid Type:</strong> Twist-off and chug cap | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes | <strong>BPA-Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-insulated-thermoflask-double-wall-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-water-bottle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Insulated</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thermoflask Stainless Steel Water Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Thermoflask Double Wall Vacuum Stainless Steel Insulated Water Bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/COyfuDezrPXvoWPIilyw18nhvkc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Thermoflask-Double-Wall-Vacuum-Stainless-Steel-Insulated-Water-Bottle-0d64f5db7c834c7b831e6664a17c2327.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>You can choose between a chug or a spout lid.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a convenient handle and is easy to tote around.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It holds a large volume of water.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to reusable water bottles, the name of the game is good insulation. That's why this option from Thermoflask was a standout compared to the others, with the ability to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for 12 while also having the option to use a spout or chug cap. We love that it comes with two different lids and were impressed with the versatility of this bottle. We noted that there was no chance of spills, and the handle was really convenient for carrying around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During the drop test, there was some denting that occurred, but the damage was so slight that it had no effect on the bottle's ability to stand upright and remain leak-free. The bottle got a bit heavy after being completely filled, but this is to be expected when the bottle can hold up to 40 ounces of water (2.5 pounds).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 40 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.6 x 3.8 x 14 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 14.1 ounces | <strong>Insulated: </strong>Yes, double wall | <strong>Lid Type:</strong> Spout and chug cap | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> No, hand wash | <strong>BPA-Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-filtered-brita-insulated-filtered-water-bottle-with-straw></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Filtered</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Brita Insulated Filtered Water Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" Amazon Brita Hard Sided Water Bottle With Filter, 26-Ounce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vKdGCWS0eUYbqGkrg8BJC0Kl0XQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/brita-hard-sided-water-bottle-with-filter-26-ounce-58ee16e4a11e4f7d901880f8ad65a982.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>&nbsp;Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>It's available in several colors.</p></li><li readability=1><p>It fits easily in a backpack, tote bag, or purse.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a convenient loop that makes it easy to carry.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in several soft hues, this stainless steel water bottle from Brita stands out from the rest due to its internal filter, allowing you to refill and rehydrate wherever you may be. According to the brand, the filter is said to reduce the taste and smell of chlorine in water and only needs to be changed about every two months (or after 40 gallons of water). The spout can be opened by pressing the small button at the bottom of the cap to produce a straw for drinking, which we found super convenient. We also love the design: It has a convenient loop over the top, is smooth to the touch, and it fits easily in a hand and cupholders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, this bottle did feel the effects of the drop test, as it landed on the cap and compromised the seal that kept this bottle from leaking. Thankfully it has convenient handles and is small enough for backpack pockets, cup holders, and more for safe storage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 20 ounces | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 3.23 x 3.23 x 10.83 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.32 ounces | <strong>Insulated: </strong>Yes, double wall | <strong>Lid Type:</strong> Leak-proof lid with straw | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes, top rack | <strong>BPA-Free: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-water-bottle></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Water Bottle</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Arguably the most important aspect to consider before buying a water bottle is the material. Most water bottles are made from one of three materials: stainless steel, plastic, or glass. Stainless steel is great for its insulation properties and durability. Plastic bottles tend to be lighter in weight and less expensive. However, it’s important to know whether or not the plastic is BPA-free since the chemical can seep into food or drinks being consumed from products that are made with this material, potentially causing negative health effects down the line, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>according to research conducted by the Mayo Clinic</a>. Check the label of any plastic water bottle you’re considering to determine if it is BPA-free. Glass water bottles are easy to&nbsp;clean, but they are a bit more delicate and weigh more than their stainless steel and plastic counterparts.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Insulation</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Reusable water bottles should aim to not only reduce the amount of plastic that goes to waste but also retain the temperature of your drink — that is, if it's insulated. Many water bottles are constructed with double-wall vacuum insulation, which is ideal for keeping cold drinks freezing and hot coffee scalding. However, this often ups the price of a water bottle and isn't necessary for those who want to just take their water on the go. Plastic water bottles are just as common and often come at a cheaper price, providing you with the portability of your water, but only being available for use with cold drinks (do not mix hot beverages with plastic).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lid Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another consideration when choosing a water bottle is the lid. This will determine how you open and close the bottle for refilling and cleaning as well as the type of drinking mechanism it has. Some lids have a larger opening for drinking, while others have smaller area to place your mouth. In addition, some water bottles come with several lids for different drinking methods, including chug, sip, and straw lids.&nbsp;<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Durability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's pretty easy to drop your water bottle while on a hike or walking around, so it's important to go for a kind that doesn't dent or leak easily. Stainless steel and hard, BPA-free plastics are often the best options for this type of durability, a standout model being the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Yeti Rambler 26 oz. Bottle</a> after passing the drop test with flying colors. Grace Martinez, Rock 'n' Roll Run Club Leader of the PNW Ladies Running Group, finds durability to be paramount in the search for a worthwhile water bottle. "If I was also using [it for] a hike, it'd be nice to have a sturdy bottom for the times you set it down or a clip for the backpack," she shares, touching on the extra features that really upgrade a bottle.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cleaning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another factor to keep in mind when shopping for your new water bottle is the way in which your water bottle can be cleaned. Make sure to check if the bottle is dishwasher safe or not and to clean accordingly, as non-dishwasher safe plastics can melt when exposed to sterilizing heat. The cap and bottle may have different instructions as well, as many caps are not dishwasher friendly or can only be used on the top rack while the bottle can go on the bottom.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>People / Conor Ralph</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The PEOPLE Tested team evaluated each of the 26 water bottles based on drinkability, seal, portability, insulation, durability, ease of cleaning, and value. Each product was then evaluated on a scale of one to five, one being poor and five being excellent, based on our experience with the product. First, each person tried opening the caps and testing how easy it was to take a drink. They then tested the seal to determine if it was leak-proof or had a few spills. Next, we carried the bottle around, testing the handles and feeling how heavy or light each bottle felt while full of water. The bottles were then left for six hours to see if each one remained cold, testing the water with a thermometer before and after the six hours. Our testers then evaluated the bottles' durability, dropping them from waist height three times and assessing the damage (or lack thereof) afterwards. They then were shown the prices of each bottle and our testers gave their honest feedback on whether or not they felt the value was justified.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-9f4361a3-133f-42b0-b28d-a02c9a43b1c4></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=51><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Is it better to drink from a glass or stainless steel water bottle?</span></p><p>There are pros and cons to both types of water bottles when it comes to drinkability. Glass keeps water in its purest form, by not imparting any taste or chemicals. Stainless steel can sometimes leave a metallic taste, but it is also safe from chemicals. Another big advantage for stainless steel bottles is their ability to insulate cold or hot drinks for hours which glass cannot do.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Is it OK to drink water left overnight in a water bottle?</span></p><p>Yes, if the bottle is clean and closed properly, it is safe to drink. However, you should not drink water from a disposable bottle that has been in a particularly hot environment, such as a car or the sun, for an extended period of time. In this case, chemicals can leach from the plastic into the water.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you freeze a water bottle?</span></p><p>Freezing a water bottle can be a great way to ensure you'll have an ice-cold beverage for hours. Unfortunately, putting a metal water bottle in the freezer is not recommended. Reusable plastic or disposable bottles work better and will not release chemicals through the freezing process.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you clean a water bottle?</span></p><p>You can and should clean your water bottle daily. Using warm water, a bit of dishwashing liquid, and a bottle brush, scrub the sides and bottom of the bottle as well as the lip. Then rinse thoroughly and dry with a clean dish towel or paper towel or let air dry with the lid off.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alyssa Brascia</a> is a PEOPLE commerce writer with experience covering beauty, fashion, home, and lifestyle products.
