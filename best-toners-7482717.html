Their main functions are to balance the skin's pH and prepare it for the rest of your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skincare routine</a>, as well as remove any traces of makeup and dirt without stripping the skin of natural oils that it needs to stay nourished. If it seems like there is an overwhelming amount of products in that category, that’s because different toners are designed to do different things: Some exfoliate and brighten the skin, while others hydrate and soothe.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"It's important to pay attention to the ingredients and choose a toner best suited for your skin needs," board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Margarita Lolis, MD</a> tells PEOPLE. She notes that if your skin tends to be on the dry or sensitive side, it’s especially important to look for alcohol-free toners since alcohol can strip the skin of moisture, and that toners and essences with hyaluronic acid and amino acids "can help restore and maintain lost moisture." For oilier and acne-prone skin, Dr. Lolis says ingredients like beta hydroxy acids like salicylic acid can help exfoliate the skin, "so pore-clogging gunk like bacteria and dead skin cells have a lesser chance of causing breakouts." Likewise, if you have hyperpigmentation or are looking for skin-brightening products, "toners with gentle lactic acid can help to gently exfoliate the skin without damaging the skin barrier," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help narrow down all of the choices, we tested 24 toners to see how they held up against each other in treating the skin. We looked at the formula's consistency and texture, how well it absorbed into the skin, the level of hydration, and, of course, how our skin felt after using. The best toners scored high in all of our categories and addressed various skin concerns like hyperpigmentation, acne, redness, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the 11 best toners that PEOPLE tested.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-fresh-rose--hyaluronic-acid-deep-hydration-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fresh Rose &amp;amp; Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lZPD_-GG75GPIITCPHQN3kFAztw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fresh-1946c062b86e478a8bf29df87d42f706.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Boasts a lightweight texture that doesn’t feel oily or greasy</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Absorbs into the skin almost instantly without having to pat it in</p></li><li readability=1><p>Contains ingredients that target dryness, dullness, and uneven texture</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Fresh Rose & Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Toner stood out among the toners we tested — so let's get into it. Receiving a perfect score in absorption, hydration, consistency, and appearance, we loved that our skin appeared brighter and more even-toned after using it. Because this milky formula gently sinks into the skin almost instantly, it left no stickiness or residue. Plus, the combination of hyaluronic acid, rose water, and angelica leaf extract targeted dryness, dullness, and uneven texture by plumping, hydrating, and minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Since it didn't strip our skin of its natural moisture, it's also gentle enough for daily use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking at how our skin felt after using the Fresh toner, we were left with skin feeling clean, refreshed, hydrated, and free of impurities — we even saw some residue and dead skin leftover on the cotton pad after swiping. The toner visibly improved the appearance of hyperpigmentation, dark spots, and irritation caused by acne, leaving the skin feeling smoother and more even, and left us with no heaviness or stickiness. If you're looking for a foolproof toner that leaves your skin feeling more hydrated and vibrant, this is the toner for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid<strong>, </strong>rose fruit extract, rosewater, angelica leaf extract&nbsp;| <strong>Skin type: </strong>All | <strong>&nbsp;Size:</strong> 8.4 oz. | <strong>Alcohol-free:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-neutrogena-alcohol-free-facial-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Facial Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/X9S6TIZA-2_XL8ajybvYbOIey2o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Neutrogena-Alcohol-Free-Facial-Toner-3cb8633714824d499972f26a23faac14.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Completely absorbs within 2-3 minutes</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Skin feels hydrated immediately after application</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We noticed that the skin looked clear after just one use</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to skincare, sometimes the budget-friendly option is just as exceptional as a splurge. This Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner is a prime example of that. This water-based formula is gentle on both oily and sensitive skin, making it a great option for those prone to breakouts and irritation. It’s lightweight on the skin and takes about two to three minutes to absorb, leaving behind zero residue and making skin looking clear with a boost of hydration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This toner is easy to use and gentle, cleansing the skin without stripping it of its natural moisture.

Pitera is a vitamin and amino acid-rich liquid derived from natural fermentation. SK-II uses Pitera in its products to promote soft, smooth, and clear skin. We tested the SK-II Facial Treatment Clear Lotion Toner, which combines the power of Pitera with alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) to gently exfoliate and hydrate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that this toner was truly weightless and quickly absorbed into the skin, leaving our skin feeling hydrated and invigorated, almost like we just splashed our face with cold water. This product is particularly suitable for sensitive skin or as a prep before using serums and oils. Another plus is that it doesn't clog pores, making it a safe choice if you're concerned with breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for hydration, our forehead moisture reading skyrocketed from 19.2 percent to 34 percent after application. Not only did our skin feel super hydrated, but we also noticed a significant improvement in texture. The rough patches were gone, and our skin felt smooth and even. Plus, the toner was ultra-gentle on our sensitive skin and fragrance-free — we didn't notice any irritation at all. It noticeably sloughed off dead skin and gave us a clean, fresh canvas for the rest of our skincare routine.&nbsp;In terms of formula, this toner does not have the texture or consistency of a lotion despite its name — so don't expect that kind of creamy feel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we recommend the SK-II Facial Treatment Clear Lotion Toner to anyone looking for a luxurious and effective addition to their skincare routine. While it costs $80 per bottle, we think it's a worthy investment; however, just be careful when pouring out the product to a cotton round — the bottle can easily dispense too much, and it would be a shame to use more than you need with this kind of price tag!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star ingredients: </strong>AHA, niacinamide, Pitera | <strong>Skin type: </strong>All | <strong>Size:</strong> 5.4 oz. | <strong>Alcohol-free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-spray-tower-28-sos-daily-rescue-facial-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Spray</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tower 28 SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tower 28 SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/GSNWC1w1qiu-xlME2tOf3NgT5qg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/t28-eb5da27188cf40b1bc56c17f8d2e7825.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Spray bottle makes it super easy to apply and perfect for the on-the-go skincare</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Leaves behind no heaviness or stickiness on the skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Practically weightless formula</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Skincare that is effortless yet effective is a dream come true.

This pH-balancing formula comprises simple yet effective ingredients: water and sodium chloride.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Hailey Bieber considers this a favorite</a>, using it to soothe her irritated and inflamed skin. During testing, we noticed that it gave our own skin a brighter appearance that looked healthier and more vibrant, enriching the skin with a light and even layer of hydration that soaked in immediately. What was left was a natural glow that wasn't sticky or heavy — but what we loved most is that it made dark spots less noticeable and minimized the appearance of pores. We love that this product is convenient to take with you on the go, making it easy to refresh your skin with a quick spritz, no matter where you are or where you're going.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Hypochlorous acid<strong> </strong>|<strong> Skin type: </strong>Acne-prone |<strong> Size:</strong> 4 oz. | <strong>Alcohol-free:</strong> Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Tower 28 Beauty SOS Save.Our.Skin Daily Rescue Facial Spray" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/B32xDwrQuEr4j2l7YHAO22vaXY0=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-Tower-28-Beauty-SOS-Save-Our-Skin-Daily-Rescue-Facial-Spray-JHETT-0067-b6f2b9f66c354426acfbb42c95df634a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3932 data-sizes=750px alt="Tower 28 SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/m88GoVit6HToCGi4HO1e5eLBwjo=/fit-in/1500x3932/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-toners-test-tower28-sos-daily-rescue-facial-spray-jjuliao-10122022-12671-2954d55a7d88436a9b4aeaaf90f45987.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-milky-fenty-beauty-fat-water-hydrating-milky-toner-essence-with-hyaluronic-acid-and-tamarind></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Milky</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Fat Water Toner Essence</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Fenty Beauty Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence with Hyaluronic Acid and Tamarind" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zRGCa1YOKbvzlh851QxiOQhJ1OY=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Fenty-Beauty-Fat-Water-Hydrating-Milky-Toner-Essence-with-Hyaluronic-Acid-and-Tamarind-029e982d116e4d8a8b9704d8725cff09.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Very lightweight formula that was easy to apply</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Absorbed into the skin in less than 3 minutes and instantly calmed the skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Milky consistency makes it easy to pace how much toner you are dispensing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What do niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, Barbados cherry, Kalahari melon, and green tea extracts have in common? They work together to protect your skin barrier and leave your skin plump and radiant. These ingredients are also found in Fenty Skin's Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner. Protecting and maintaining the skin barrier has been a popular topic recently, as it shields our skin from external irritants and moisture loss. When the skin barrier is damaged, it can lead to inflammation, itchiness, and premature aging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Besides protecting the skin barrier, the Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner is quick-absorbing and won't leave any residue or film. Not only does it reduce the appearance of fine lines and hyperpigmentation, but it also improves overall skin tone and reduces oiliness. We were left with fresh and clean skin and a subtle glow on our cheeks. Another bonus was the much-needed moisture boost, resulting in a more refreshed appearance. If you're seeking a hydrating toner that gives your skin a radiant glow, the Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner by Fenty Beauty is an absolute must-have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star ingredients: </strong>Niacinamide | <strong>Skin type: </strong>Normal,<strong> </strong>dry | <strong>Size:</strong> 5 oz. | <strong>Alcohol-free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hyperpigmentation-freck-beauty-cactus-water-cleansing-lactic-acid-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hyperpigmentation</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Freck Beauty Cactus Water Lactic Acid Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Freck Beauty Cactus Water Cleansing Lactic Acid Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wnGqJR-g9wZxpF7rIxu_CrI0S04=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/freck-cactus-water-cleansing-lactic-acid-toner-e591d5febe73413582e23c3146bd2ae5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Freck Beauty</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Absorbs into the skin right away</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Proved to significantly increase skin hydration levels in our testing</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Protects against environmental stressors like pollution and UV rays</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Freck Beauty's Cactus Water is unique because it features cactus flower extract and kelp extract as key ingredients. Cactus flower extract soothes and hydrates the skin while protecting it from environmental stressors like pollution and UV rays, which can cause moisture loss and signs of aging. Our own testing showed a significant improvement in hydration, starting from a very dry 33 percent moisture reading and spiking to a normal/combination skin level of 44 percent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This toner also contains powerful exfoliant lactic acid that aids in removing dead skin and minimizes discoloration. After using this toner, we immediately noticed plumper, more hydrated skin with a healthy glow. Free of any residue or stickiness after application, it feels like a refreshing drink of water for your face and applies similarly to that of micellar water. However, don't expect visible changes in hyperpigmentation, blemishes, or dark spots after just one use. As with most skincare products, it takes a few weeks of consistent use to see significant differences. While it's alcohol-free, the fragranced formula could irritate those with sensitive skin. We also found that dispensing the product was less seamless compared to other toners we tested, and it takes a few shakes to get out the desired amount, although this wasn't at all a deal-breaker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star ingredients: </strong>Lactic acid, cactus flower extract, kelp extract<strong> </strong>| <strong>Skin type:&nbsp; </strong>All skin types, including acne-prone | <strong>Size:</strong> 6.5 oz. | <strong>Alcohol-free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-belif-aqua-bomb-hydrating-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hydrating</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Belif Aqua Bomb Hydrating Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="belif Aqua Bomb Hydrating Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/aEhp-_UK2zmwUCess5fb5uJiOVw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/belif-Aqua-Bomb-Hydrating-Toner-9bfa599fc601470589e7c627c7ff246e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Consistency makes it easy to apply and fully absorbed into the skin within two minutes — you don't even need to pat it in</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Skin felt calmer and more moisturized right away</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We also saw a reduction in hyperpigmentation and the appearance of pores and fine lines<br></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're tired of dry, parched skin and on the hunt for a product that will quench your skin's thirst, look no further than this lightweight toner that will give your skin the hydration boost it craves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Belif Aqua Bomb Hydrating Toner soothes and calms your skin thanks to the power of honeysuckle — its anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties leaves skin feeling nourished and refreshed.

After applying, however, we noticed a visible improvement in our skin's appearance; our skin looked brighter, more even-toned, and had a luminous and natural-looking glow. Hyperpigmentation and the appearance of fine lines and pores were also reduced, leaving our skin hydrated and refreshed. Plus, the watery, clear consistency is easy to apply and fully absorbed in about two minutes.

Its formula, which contains witch hazel, niacinamide, and AHA, work together to tighten, firm, and balance pH levels while regulating sebum production, reducing pore appearance, and leaving skin clearer and healthier-looking. It also brightens the skin, evens skin tone, and fades hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles. The AHAs offer potent exfoliating benefits for a smoother, more even complexion. However, our favorite part was the proof of hydration. After using this toner, our moisture reading peaked from 48.6 percent to 99 percent on our cheeks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">SKKN's toner feels weightless on the skin, though it may feel slightly sticky upon initial application.

Our skin felt tremendously more hydrated, and we noticed a visible difference in the areas where the toner was applied compared to where it wasn't. The appearance of our skin felt clean, refreshed, and hydrated, with a brighter and more even complexion overall.

This toner contains natural ingredients like witch hazel and grape seed extract, which together regulate oil production and tighten pores while protecting against free radicals that can damage the skin and cause premature aging. Not only do these ingredients provide excellent benefits for the skin, but it also leaves skin looking glowy, smooth, and glossy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While testing this toner, we immediately noticed how it replenished moisture in our dry skin, making it feel refreshed and revitalized. We were also impressed by how it helped reduce the visibility of dark spots, resulting in a more even complexion. After cleansing with face wash, we noticed more dirt on the cotton pad after wiping our face with the toner, making us feel like our skin was thoroughly clean because of it. While it left us with silky smooth skin that felt clean and refreshed, we must note that some people may experience a temporary tingling sensation once it dries down.

It has a distinct texture that isn't too watery or thick, almost creamy. It felt light and cool when first applied; however, it was a bit sticky to the touch. After application, the toner dried down to a natural finish on the face, leaving our skin looking brighter and firmer. We visibly noticed a reduction in the redness on our skin and a calming of the swelling caused by acne and rosacea. Right away, we noticed that our skin looked even more radiant, even and more firm after use. Acne and rosacea appeared less red and swollen, while pores felt more open and appeared less clogged. For those with sensitive skin looking for a healthier, more balanced complexion, the alcohol-free Holifrog Utopia Microflora Toner is a great option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star ingredients: </strong>Sodium hypochlorite, aloe barbadensis leaf, jojoba seed oil, apple cider vinegar | <strong>Skin type: </strong>Balanced, normal, dry, sensitive |<strong> Size:</strong> 4.05 oz.&nbsp;| <strong>Alcohol-free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-redness-innisfree-green-tea-seed-hyaluronic-acid-toner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Redness</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Toner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Innisfree Green Tea Hyaluronic Acid Toner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/iopLwdaW-LxV7UE60pzfzehjZgc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Green-Tea-Hyaluronic-Acid-Hydrating-Toner-38b1adc229c7483e91605bff7d352989.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hydration</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=1><p>Instantly relieves the skin; when it came to irritation and redness, our skin felt more hydrated and calm after just 3 minutes</p></li><li readability=0><p>Effectively reduces the appearance of pores and helped heal breakouts, including hormonal acne</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're familiar with color theory, you know that green and red sit on opposite sides of the color wheel and are known to neutralize each other, so it made total sense that Innisfree's Green Tea Toner performs remarkably well on sensitive, redness-prone skin. We experienced instant relief from redness and irritation after using this toner. Formulated with green tea sourced from Jeju Island in Korea and containing 16 amino acids, Innisfree carefully selected this specific green tea for this toner after evaluating over 3,301 different types.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This toner is hydrating and has a light and gentle consistency that is absorbed in about a minute. We were especially impressed by how quickly redness and irritation subsided, and even the appearance of breakouts reduced. This toner also tackled hormonal acne surprisingly well. What amazed us most was its ability to reduce redness within three minutes of application. Our skin was irritated before application, but we loved how it felt soothed and looked glowy after using this product. If you're searching for a product that reduces redness and calms irritated skin, Innisfree's Green Tea Toner is definitely worth considering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Jeju green tea |<strong> Skin type: </strong>All skin types | <strong>&nbsp;Size: </strong>6.76 oz.&nbsp;| <strong>Alcohol-free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-toner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Toner</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin type&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your skin type is an important factor to consider when you’re picking a toner. People with oiler or acne-prone skin should look for toners with BHA (beta hydroxy acids) or salicylic acids to help exfoliate their skin and unclog pores. According to Margarita Lolis, this can help remove dead skin cells and lessen the chance of breakouts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have dry skin, try to avoid products with witch hazel and alcohol, as these ingredients can further dry out the skin. Hyaluronic acid and amino acids are great ingredients to look out for because they can help restore the skin barrier and lock in moisture. If you’re looking for a solution for hyperpigmentation, look for toners with lactic acids — this can help “gently exfoliate the skin without damaging the skin barrier,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Lolis</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Alcohol</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although it's important to look for alcohol-free toners if you have dry skin, alcohol is often included in toners because it effectively removes oil, dirt, and other impurities from the skin's surface. Alcohol can be beneficial in toners if you have incredibly oily skin since it can combat pore congestion. When deciding between an alcohol-free toner and one that contains alcohol, it's important to see if it includes other ingredients that restore moisture, like hyaluronic acid or other oils. For example, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Murad Clarifying Toner</a> offsets the alcohol with grapeseed extract, which helps replenish the skin's moisture.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to purchasing skincare products, price is often a major consideration. However, if you're on the hunt for a high-quality toner that you can use daily, you don't necessarily have to break the bank. While splurging on luxury skincare can be a treat, choosing a more affordable product doesn't mean you have to compromise on quality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are a variety of affordable toners on the market that are just as effective as their pricier counterparts. Two of our favorites include the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Innisfree's Green Tea Toner</a>, both of which are priced around $20.

The<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"> SK-II Facial Treatment Clear Lotion Toner</a>, for example, is a lightweight and ultra-refreshing option with a price tag of $80, serving as the perfect base for layering other serums and moisturizers on top of it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of how much you're willing to spend on your toner, you must consider your skin concerns and the type of toner that will best address them.

We noted the consistency of the toner, how well it absorbed into the skin, and if we noticed any significant differences in our skin's texture and clarity. We also measured our skin’s moisture levels once more after the toner was applied, so we could see how hydration levels were affected by the toner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, we rated each of the 24 toners on a 1 to 5 scale against the following categories: feel, absorption, hydration, and appearance.
