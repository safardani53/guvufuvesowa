world, find out where JC is today.</p><p>JC was born on August 8 ,1976 in Bowie, Maryland.</p><p>He was a shy child who was adopted by his mother's foster parents at five years old.</p><p>The former boy bander developed an interest in singing and dancing to boost his confidence and won a national dancing competition at the age of 13.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ABOUT *NSYNC">READ MORE ABOUT *NSYNC</h2><p>When his mother saw an ad in the Washington Post for a new Disney show she encouraged him to try out, and the rest was history.</p><h2 id=before-nsync>BEFORE *NSYNC</h2><p>Before JC was in *<a href=#>NSYNC</a>, he appeared in The All-New Mickey Mouse Club.</p><p>He was cast as a performer in the show's fourth season and stayed until its end in 1994.</p><p>Since there was another castmate named Josh, he went by the initials JC.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The Mickey Mouse club brought JC out of his shell and allowed him to make new friends along the way.</p><p>Along with him, other notable performers on his seasons were <a href=#>Christina Aguilera</a>, <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>, <a href=#>Britney Spears,</a> Keri Russell, and future bandmate, <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>.</p><h2 id=it-s-gonna-be-him>IT'S GONNA BE HIM</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000652980951.jpg><p>One year after leaving The Mickey Mouse Club, JC struck gold again when a guy named Chris Kirkpatrick reached out to him to see if he wanted to be in a boy band.</p><p>Luckily, he said yes, after finding out Justin was going to be a part of it too.</p><p>To complete the band, Lance Bass and Joey Fatone joined JC, Justin, and Chris.</p><p>After becoming popular in Europe, *NSYNC released their first self-titled album in 1998, featuring the hits I Want You Back, Tearin' Up My Heart, and Here We Go.</p><p>They became extremely popular in America, dropped their old manager, Lou Pearlman, and signed with Jive Records.</p><p>In 2000, the band released their second album, No Strings Attached, which featured the songs Bye, Bye, Bye, It's Gonne Be Me, and This I Promise You.</p><p>It became the best-selling album in a week of all time, selling over 2.4 million copies.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The band held that record</a> until 2015 when Adele's 25 beat it.</p><p>Their third, and final album, Celebrity, was released in 2001 and spawned the songs Pop, Girlfriend, and Gone.</p><p>After the Celebrity Tour in 2002, the band decided to take an indefinite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hiatus</a> to pursue solo projects.</p><h2 id=going-solo>GOING SOLO</h2><p>After the band split up, and Justin had major success with his solo album, Justified, JC decided to go solo too.</p><p>He released his first and only solo album, Schizophrenic, in 2004.</p><p>After his first album got pushed aside due to the Justin/Janet Jackson Halftime fiasco, he decided to make another record.</p><p>JC's second album, The Story of Kate, was supposed to be released in 2006.</p><p>He even released two singles called Until Yesterday and You Ruined Me, but the album was eventually scrapped when JC and Jive Records parted ways in 2007.</p><p>Although he stopped singing for a while, JC continued to work as a songwriter and producer.</p><h2 id=judging-and-writing>JUDGING AND WRITING</h2><p>In 2008, JC became a judge on the MTV show, America's Best Dance Crew.</p><p>He stayed on for all seven seasons until the show ended in 2012.</p><p>During that time, JC wrote songs for David Archuleta, Matthew Morrison, <a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>, AJ McLean, <a href=#>McFly</a>, and many others.</p><p>In 2012, he held auditions because he wanted to form an all-girl group called Girl Radical.</p><p>Although the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">band did release a few songs, </a>his project fell flat and Girl Radical never blew up.</p><p>When that fell through JC joined the North American tour of Jesus Christ, Superstar as Puntius Pilate.</p><p>Sadly, <a href=#>the tour was canceled</a> in May 2014, due to poor ticket sales.</p><h2 id=getting-the-band-back-together>GETTING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER</h2><p>Although *NSYNC has not released a new song since their hiatus, they have reunited over the years for special events.</p><p>Besides birthdays, weddings, and other personal events, the members of *NSYNC broke the internet when they reunited in 2013 for Justin's <a href=#>VMA </a>Video Vanguard performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

songs.</p><p>JC and his bandmates were honored in 2018 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</a></p><p>All five of the men attended and were honored by Ellen DeGeneres and Carson Daly.</p><p>In 2019, <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> got to live out every '90s girl's dream by bringing JC, Lance, Joey, and Chris (Justin was on tour at the time) to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Coachella stage.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Girlfriend, I'm bored, so the band performed that and Tearin' Up My Heart.</p><p>"I've been waiting my whole life for this moment, *NSYNC!," she announced to Coachella and the crowd went crazy.</p><p>In 2020, JC and the other band members appeared on Lance's podcast to talk about the anniversary of No Strings Attached.</p><p><a href=#>They later had a Zoom call, sans Justin</a>, to celebrate Lance's birthday.</p><p>The band has not performed together since, but they have hung out from time to time without performing.</p><h2 id=where-is-he-now>WHERE IS HE NOW?</h2><p>After *NSYNC disbanded, he starred in a few episodes of shows here and there and had small parts in films.</p><p>After ABDC ended, JC stuck to producing and writing songs for other artists and took the spotlight off of himself.</p><p>He was seen out in LA last year <a href=#>looking unrecognizable </a>while running errands with his current girlfriend, Jennifer HuYoung.</p><img
