I had the leisure side of the business.”</p><p>Britannic Travel went on to stratospheric success, being sold to Australian group Flight Centre for £45m in 2003.</p><p>Spence stayed in charge until 2008, helping the company to a record £8.3m profit on £29.6m sales in 2006-07.</p><h2>BEST DEAL WAS AT CHELSEA</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunday Times</a>, who put Spence’s wealth at £45m in 2009, said he made £16.4m in dividends and salaries between 1997 and 2002.</p><p>But despite his success, Spence reckons his best bit of business was getting invited onto the top table at <a href=#>Chelsea</a> by former Blues owner Ken Bates.</p><p>Spence, who owned two horses called John Terry and Super Frank, told th<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">e Racing Post</a>: “When Ken asked me to get involved, I was very flattered.</p><p>“He's an entrepreneur, very much like me, but flamboyant and in the public eye.</p><p>“I had a lot of respect for him, but Chelsea got sold and that was great, too.

THEN BECAME BIG WINNER</h2><p>Recalling how he got involved in the sport, Spence told the Racing Post: “I wasn't really into racing.</p><p>“But I met Arthur [Pitt, famous trainer] in a pub and thought he was a bit of a character and a bit of fun, so I bought a horse at the sales in 1971 called Starch Reduced for 1,000 guineas, and it won first time out in 1972 by four lengths with Lester Piggott up.</p><p>“Those were fun days. It's still fun now, but the operation's bigger and it takes more managing and, when I'm not doing consultancy work or on the phone or on the gallops or at the races, then I'm at the sales a lot with trainers.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).
