Still, these are the times — particularly when it’s hot — that it’s more important than ever to keep your pup well-hydrated. Enter the beauty of a portable dog water bottle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Dogs, unlike humans, cannot regulate their temperature through sweating. Instead, they pant to cool down, during which saliva evaporates to cool the surrounding blood vessels of the mouth and tongue,” explains dog trainer&nbsp;Steve Frost, KPA CTP, president and lead trainer of A Sound Beginning Chicago. “Having a portable water bottle on-hand allows us to help our dogs replenish the fluids lost when panting, which can effectively combat overheating and even heatstroke, ensuring our pets remain safe and comfortable in warmer weather,” he says. And these days, there are plenty of options out there, offering a little something for every situation and every pup’s preference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead are some of the best portable dog water bottles, according to vets and dog trainers.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-malsipree-dog-water-bottle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MalsiPree Dog Water Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MalsiPree Dog Water Bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/MhuHLV96iXIO98vwhc9bcVkLKLs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MalsiPree-Dog-Water-Bottle-af86642793e14c9786b47f9b53728ea2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Bernal is a fan of this pick for its built-in bowl and ease of use. “It’s a great, compact choice for when you and your dog are on the go," she says. "You can easily turn the bottle to the side and push the button to let water flow in the bowl." It also comes in two sizes, the smaller of which is especially good for puppies and smaller breeds. Either way, the overall size of the bottle is similar to that of a standard (human) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>water bottle</a>, so it easily fits in places such as cup holders and water bottle pouches on backpacks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A silica gel ring coupled with a lock button feature helps ward off unwanted leaks and spills. One major drawback: It definitely can’t be put in the dishwasher, which does make cleaning it a bit of an extra chore. It also bears mentioning that it’s not BPA-free. "This is the water bottle you see at every single dog park," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE senior commerce writer Madison Yauger</a>. "My dog loves it, and it's so convenient to carry around."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Water capacity:</strong> 12 oz., 19 oz. | <strong>Size: </strong>3 x 3 x 8 inches, 3 x 3 x 10 inches | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> No |<strong> Material:&nbsp; </strong>Plastic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-gulpy-water-dispenser-for-pet></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gulpy Water Dispenser for Pet</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Gulpy portable dog water bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6gAjjBwQaRXmzyLk-8wwgKT2j7k=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gulpydogwaterbottle-cfe56f6156044f4ab6fbf82af7a86d33.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gulpy</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Those looking for a sturdy, long-lasting option.

Flip down the bowl (which is really more of a drinking trough) and give the bottle a few squeezes to dispense the water.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also nice: You can pop in standard plastic water bottles in place of the included one, and it has a clip that makes it easy to attach to your belt or waistband and take with you on walks. (Because it’s so light, you’ll barely notice it.) Just be sure to hand wash it in order to maintain the integrity of the plastic material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Water capacity:</strong> 10 oz. | <strong>Size: </strong>4.3 x 4.3 x 9 inches | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>Bottle is, lid isn’t | <strong>Material:&nbsp; </strong>Thermoplastic polymer</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hiking-springer-classic-dog-travel-bottle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Hiking</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Springer Classic Dog Travel Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=926 data-sizes=750px alt="springer classic dog water bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3MCoSj9CYyoRtQCrpW4ut-BSPrk=/fit-in/1500x926/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-07-21at2.11.08PM-591ea1721b4c42389ca099fb0122c4cf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>QVC</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Freyer calls this “one of his favorites,” thanks to an innovative design that both prevents you from wasting water as well as minimizes spills. How it works: Grip and squeeze the bottle, and water will flow into the bowl that’s attached at the top. Once your pup is done drinking, release your grip, and any leftover water will go back into the bottle. It’s perfect for situations where you want to make sure you’re not wasting any H20 — think during hikes or when access to refills may be limited for a while.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fact that the built-in bowl is an actual bowl is good for picky drinkers, though it does make carrying it around slightly more annoying since everything isn’t tucked in and compact. However, the attached fastener strap makes for a convenient hand strap, and there’s also a loop to add a carabiner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Water capacity:</strong> 20 oz. | <strong>Size: </strong>4.25 x 3.5 x 8.5 inches | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>No | <strong>Material: </strong>BPA-free polypropylene</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stainless-steel-petfusion-portable-insulated-dog-water-bottle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Stainless Steel</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PetFusion Water Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=593 data-sizes=750px alt="PetFusion Portable Dog Water Bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/WN9YzoFcavASvZkprsvPtb4u41Y=/fit-in/1500x593/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Petfusion-5081485423b9466fb09c9336fea1fa86.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This 22-oz. water bottle is perfect if you’re looking for a more durable, heavy-duty option,” says Dr. Bernal of another one of her favorites. She also points out that because it’s made of double-walled stainless steel (which is also BPA- and phthalate-free), it has the added benefit of keeping water cold for up to eight hours, a nice perk for your pup on hot days. Plus, the entire thing is dishwasher-safe, making cleaning a breeze.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It does come with a carabiner clip for easy attachment, but just keep in mind that it won’t fit in standard cup holders. You also will need to have both hands free in order to unscrew the top and pour the water into the attached bowl; the silicone grip on the outside helps with the grip in that scenario. However, the included bowl does have a nice wide mouth that makes it a good choice for many sizes of dogs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Water capacity:</strong> 22 oz. | <strong>Size: </strong>3.6 x 3.8 x 8.4 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>8 oz. | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>Yes | <strong>Material:&nbsp; </strong>Stainless steel</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-dogs-kong-h2o-stainless-steel-dog-water-bottle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Large Dogs</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>KONG H2O Stainless Steel Dog Water Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1066 data-sizes=750px alt="kong h20 water bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/55Ays1PnmcsUB-AUyjhf2vDUq6s=/fit-in/1500x1066/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-07-21at2.47.51PM-38b2def3ff584abdbe61263192c7e367.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jamie Freyer, DVM, a veterinarian at&nbsp;Veterinarians.org, recommends this choice, which holds an impressive 25 oz. of water and is great for bigger dogs or longer outdoor adventures. He likes that it’s made from BPA-, phthalate-free stainless steel and boasts a two-in-one design; unscrew the bottom portion and turn it into a bowl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We like that the entire bottle is made from recyclable and sustainable materials, including even an eco-friendly paint finish. Just keep in mind that it does need to be hand-washed, and because it is a bit larger than many other dog water bottles, it can feel slightly bulky and more cumbersome. You’ll also need to have two hands free in order to use it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Water capacity:</strong> 25 oz. | <strong>Size: </strong>9.5 x 3.25 x 3.25 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>0.7 lbs. | <strong>Dishwasher Safe: </strong>No | <strong>Material:&nbsp; </strong>Stainless steel</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-long-trips-lixit-water-boy-travel-water-bowl></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Long Trips</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lixit Water Boy Travel Water Bowl</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Lixit Water Boy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QFMmrChEXPQ6HqFCDqEazmFyu7o=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lixitdogwaterbowl-7c3b1e36f3134365aea27c7f430f07df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lixit</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a whopping 3-qt. water capacity, Frost says this bowl is great for large and giant breed dogs; it’s also perfect for situations such as camping or in RVs, or even the car. (To that point, because it is so large, it’s definitely less portable and not the right pick to take with you on hikes and walks.) Still, it has a spill- and splash-proof design — it won’t spill even if it’s turned upside down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s also a built-in bowl, and it is very reasonably priced, given how large it is. While it is large, it’s also very lightweight, thanks to the fact that it’s made from BPA-free plastic. And if you have two dogs that each want their own water bowl, it’s conveniently sold in a set of two.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Water capacity:</strong> 3 qt. | <strong>Size: </strong>8 x 3 x 12.2 inches | <strong>Weight: </strong>0.01 oz. | <strong>Material:&nbsp; </strong>BPA-free plastic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-filter-jollypup-portable-smart-water-bottle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Filter</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>JollyPup Portable Smart Water Bottle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="JollyPup Portable Smart Water Bottle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Msu93-1tfR3Dhkyv87m65eT-C1Q=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/JollyPupportabledogwaterbottle-9a2a194c8e844bf0a55df79a6e3f2daa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>JollyPup</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this option is pricier than many of the other portable dog water bottles out there (and the most expensive one on this list), it’s well worth every penny. First and foremost, it touts a built-in filter: “Water filters are a great way to ensure your dog is getting the best quality water he or she can drink, no matter where you go,” says Dr. Bernal. It’s also perfect for taking with you on the go; it has a removable lanyard that makes it easy to attach to any bag or even carry on your wrist. And if you do want to stash it inside a backpack or bag, you won’t have to stress about spills, says Frost. He’s a big fan of the leak-proof design (courtesy of an internal O-ring), as well as the inline bowl that slides out, a great space-saving element.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The design is both streamlined and stylish; the bottle even comes in four different colors.

Will you be using it every day or just occasionally? Dr. Bernal says the first thing to think about before choosing a portable dog water bottle is how you’ll be using it, as this will dictate certain other features you need to consider.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Capacity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s important to make sure the bottle you choose can hold enough water for your dog, notes Dr. Bernal. In general, dogs should drink approximately 1 oz. of water per pound of body weight per day, although there are a lot of other factors that can affect this amount, she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Portability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is the whole point of the bottle being a ‘portable’ dog water bottle, after all. Ideally, you want a dog water bottle that’s either easy to carry in your hands or has some type of attachment so that it can be clipped to a bag, like the&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Springer Classic Dog Travel Bottle</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">PetFusion Portable Insulated Dog Water Bottle</a>&nbsp;offerings.

Some you simply need to squeeze or tip over, others you may need to actually unscrew and pour into a bowl. To that point, some of them have a built-in bowl, while others do not.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should you fill the bottle with tap or bottled water?</span></p><p>Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference. However, if you choose to go with tap water, Dr. Bernal notes that filtering, if possible, ensures your dog will be getting the highest-quality water possible. (Or look for a bottle with a filter built in like the JollyPup offering!)</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How can you teach a dog to drink from a water bottle?</span></p><p>It can be challenging, particularly for dogs who have larger and/or longer tongues that won’t fit inside the bottle.
