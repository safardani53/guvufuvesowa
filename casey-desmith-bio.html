Instead, the Penguins initially signed him on a two-way contract.</p><p>But, he worked hard and, through blood, sweat, and tears, earned his way to the top.</p><p>So, to inspire our dear readers, we here at Playersbio have written this article to guide you through his early life to his current days with the Penguins.</p><p>You will also find intel on his net worth, contract, salary, age, height, nationality, family, kids, and social media.

As a matter of fact, he was even named to the Hockey East All-Rookie in his first year.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Colliton Bio: Wife, Career, Salary, Contract, Record, Age Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>However, an incident in 2014 involving his girlfriend led to his being suspended from the team.</p><p>To explain, Desmith got arrested for assaulting his former lover. After that, the 28-year-old could never regain his spot on the Wildcats team due to his criminal record.</p><h2>Casey DeSmith | Ice Hockey Career</h2><p>Casey’s professional career started with the Wheeling Nailers in the ECHL. Subsequently, the 28-year-old played just 13 games for the franchise before moving to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in the AHL.</p><p>During his time with the Penguins, Desmith established himself as one of the most reliable goaltenders in the league.</p><p>Moreover, by the time he finished with the Penguins, Casey had played in 62 games, managing three shutouts.</p><p>Thus, having performed very well in the AHL, Scranton Penguins‘ NHL affiliate team Pittsburgh Penguins signed the 28-year-old on a one-year two-way contract.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/desmith-986.jpg><p>Following solid outings during the chances he was given, the Penguins signed DeSmith on a three-year <strong>$3.75 million deal</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the New Hampshire native has proved himself to be one of the best substitute goaltenders in the league.</p><p>In fact, DeSmith managed a total of 50 games, managing an impressive four shutouts during his last two years with the Penguins.</p><p>Added to that, Casey is also an elite professional who never complains about his lack of playing time.</p><p>Instead, he relishes the opportunity to play in the NHL and knows his time will come in the future. But, as for now, DeSmith is content with the role he is being given.</p><h2>Casey DeSmith | Stats</h2><table width=1122><tbody><tr><td width=94>Year</td><td width=94>GP</td><td width=94>GS</td><td width=94>W</td><td width=94>L</td><td width=94>OT</td><td width=94>SA</td><td width=94>GA</td><td width=94>GAA</td><td width=94>SV%</td><td width=94>SO</td><td width=94>MIN</td></tr><tr><td width=94>Career</td><td width=94>70</td><td width=94>58</td><td width=94>32</td><td width=94>22</td><td width=94>6</td><td width=94>1959</td><td width=94>165</td><td width=94>2.62</td><td width=94>.916</td><td width=94>6</td><td width=94>3,777</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can get more details on his stats and game log on <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN.</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Age, Height & Nationality</h2><p>At the moment, Casey is 28 years old and celebrates his birthday on the 13th of August. As a result, the New Hampshire native is a Leo when it comes to his horoscope.</p><p>Likewise, Leo’s usually enthusiastic, generous, and passionate people. And, about Desmith’s nationality, he was born in New Hampshire, which makes him American.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Sakic Bio: Wife, Career, Salary, Jersey, Net Worth, Age Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Moving on, DeSmith stands at exactly 6 feet (1.83 meters) and weighs 181 lb (82 kg), which is relatively small when compared to most other NFL players.</p><p>However, the 18-year-old plays in the goaltender position, where height is not an essential factor. Instead, Casey is amongst the most agile goaltenders in the league.</p><h3>Casey DeSmith Trades</h3><p>Talking about Casey’s trades, the 28-year-old has played for the same team where he made his debut, Pittsburgh Penguins.</p><p>Moreover, there are no rumors regarding Desmith’s trade at the moment.</p><h3>Highlights and Awards</h3><ul><li>2012 Hockey East All-Rookie Team</li><li>All-Rookie Team in 2017</li><li>2017 Harry “Hap” Holmes Memorial Award</li></ul><h2>Casey DeSmith | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>Talking about Casey’s net worth, is currently valued at <strong>$2 million,</strong> which he mustered from his playing career as a professional ice-hockey player.</p><p>Although his net worth might seem a bit low for an NHL player, contrarily, he has only been involved in professional ice hockey for six years.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raul Ruidiaz Bio: Salary, Career, Family, Stats, Wife, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Added to that, this is only his third year in the NHL. Hence, we believe that the 28-year-old still has a lot more to earn in his career.</p><p>Moving on, DeSmith is currently making a yearly salary of <strong>$1.25 million</strong> with the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p><p>Furthermore, Casey has earned over<strong> $3 million</strong> throughout his professional career.</p><p>You can get more details on his transaction and waivers on <a href=# rel=noopener>CapFriendly.</a></p><h3>Contract</h3><p>Following two relatively good seasons for a newcomer, Pittsburgh Penguins decided to hand Desmith a new three-year <strong>$3.75 million</strong> contract in 2018.</p><p>As per the deal, Casey will remain with the franchise until the 2021-22 season and will be earning <strong>$1.25 million per year</strong>. On the contrary, the 28-year-old was earning <strong>$675,000 per year</strong> before his new contract.</p><h2>Casey DeSmith | Wife & Wedding</h2><p>Taking a look at his relationship, we found out that Casey is a happily married man.</p><p>But, to emphasize,&nbsp; the New Hampshire native is involved in a romantic relationship with his wife, <strong>Ellie Pikula</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, the couple tied the knot recently in 2019&nbsp;at a lavish wedding.</p><p>Moving on, although the couple has been together for several years, they have not been lucky in the offspring department.</p><p>Maybe they’re biding time for the right moment to raise their child, or maybe they have their own reasons? Well, whatever it might be, one thing’s for sure, it is not due to a lack of romance in the relationship.</p><p>In fact, Casey’s various Instagram posts tell us that he is head over heels for his partner. Furthermore, the two lovers are not only each other’s partner but also their best friends.</p><p>Thus, we believe that this is one relationship that will stand the test of time, no matter the circumstances.</p><h2>Casey DeSmith | Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=#>Instagram</a>: 17.5k followers</p><p><a href=#>Twitter</a>: 347 followers</p><h2>Casey DeSmith | FAQs</h2><h3>Is Casey DeSmith a fan of The Office?</h3><p>Yes, the NHL player has watched and is a big fan of The Office.
