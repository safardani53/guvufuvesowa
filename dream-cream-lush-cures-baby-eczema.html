Within ten hours it had completely gone – he was just left with the scratches.</p><h3><a href=#>DON'T BE RASH <span>What is eczema, what causes the painful condition and how can you treat it?</span></a></h3><p>“His skin was transformed and he’s not had a single flare up since. It really is dream cream.</p><p>“Lots of people who have psoriasis said it worked for them. It’s obviously got some really healing benefits.</p><p>“We bought the smallest tub which cost around £6 as I wasn’t sure whether it would work. We used a tiny bit and it goes quite far.</p><p>“It’s been an absolute miracle for him and it was instant. All of the redness and the lumps had gone and his skin was clear.</p><p>“We returned to the doctor so he could have his jabs and they couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“He doesn’t need it any more but I’m still putting it on as a precaution and because it makes his skin really nice and soft.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON ECZEMA</h2></p><p>“I think it was invented by someone who suffered from psoriasis and having read the reviews it’s helped a lot of people with eczema.”</p><p>Sarah, who is also mum to Thalia, 11, Rocco, 9, Delilah, 4, Aria, 1, said Cash has now been transformed into a happy smiley baby.</p><p>Sarah said: “He was not a happy baby. He was fed up all the time.</p><p>“I remember we went to Center Parcs and there was a baby there who was around the same age and he was smiling. I said to my husband ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen Cash smile’.</p><p>“It was not until we sorted his skin out that he smiled. He was so uncomfortable for such a long time. It made him miserable.</p><p>“He’s now completely different. He smiles all the time, he’s content and he’s a really easy baby. He’s sleeping through the night and he’s a lot calmer.”</p><p>Mark Constantine, Lush co-founder and managing director said: "For me it's what the whole business is about, to deliver effective product that does a little more than it says on the pot."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mum hails £4.50 cream that 'cured' her baby's eczema that was so bad she looked like a burns victim</span><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
