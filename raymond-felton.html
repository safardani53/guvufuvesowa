However, for the next season, New York traded him off to the Denver Nuggets.</p><p>With the Nuggets, Felton again managed to reach the playoffs and went up against Oklahoma City Thunder.</p><p>But, the basketballer expressed his disappointment in playing off the bench and behind point guard <a href=# rel=noopener>Ty Lawson</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the 2010-11 season turned out to be his best season so far.</p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Portland Trail Blazers And Return To New York Knicks</span></h4><p>Following the end of the 2011 season, the Nuggets traded the American athlete to the Portland Trail Blazers.</p><p>Both he and the Blazer struggled during his debut season. At the beginning of his career with Portland, he was on bad terms with the coach.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Blazers fired the coach, and Kaleb Canales, the youngest head coach in franchise history, replaced him.</p><p>However, along with the team, he still struggled through the entire season and failed to make it to the playoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>Thereafter, Blazers traded him back to the New York Knicks. There, Felts signed a three-year extension deal worth $10 million with Knicks.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly then, fans and media heavily criticized him for his shape and weight while playing for the Blazers.</p><p>Nonetheless, Raymond admitted to being in bad shape and made no excuses.</p><p>During his playtime with Knicks, he reportedly lost over 20 lbs and stated that he was even better than 2019 NBA champion <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Lin</a> who was famous for his time with the Knicks.</p><p>For the time being of his three-year extension, Felton had a pretty decent career with the team.</p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dallas Mavericks, LA Clippers, And Oklahoma City Thunder</span></h4><p>After the 2013-14 season, the Knicks traded Raymond to the Mavericks. He missed most of the 2014-15 season due to his criminal charges and injury.</p><p>As a result, Felts had an average season in totality, and the following season wasn’t exciting either.</p><img

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Raymond-Felton-For-The-Oklahoma-City.jpg><p>Then, he signed with the LA Clippers for the 2016-2017 season and subsequently with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the next season.</p><p>After 2019, Felton became an unrestricted free agent and hasn’t signed with any other team yet.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Legal Issues</span></h2><p>When Felts was just out of Knicks, he got into legal trouble after authorities arrested him for felony gun charges.</p><p>The basketballer accepted a plea deal where he admitted to being guilty of criminal possession of a weapon and a firearm.</p><p>As a result, the prosecutors fined him $5000 and assigned him 500 hours of community service.</p><p>Furthermore, the NBA suspended the basketballer for the first four games with the Dallas Mavericks.</p><h2>Career stats</h2><table class="vk_tbl Uekwlc"><tbody><tr><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e
